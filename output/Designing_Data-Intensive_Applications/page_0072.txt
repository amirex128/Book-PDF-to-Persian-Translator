Figure 2-5. Example of graph-structured data (boxes represent vertices, arrows repre‐
sent edges).
There are several different, but related, ways of structuring and querying data in
graphs. In this section we will discuss the property graph model (implemented by
Neo4j, Titan, and InfiniteGraph) and the triple-store model (implemented by
Datomic, AllegroGraph, and others). We will look at three declarative query lan‐
guages for graphs: Cypher, SPARQL, and Datalog. Besides these, there are also
imperative graph query languages such as Gremlin [36] and graph processing frame‐
works like Pregel (see Chapter 10).
Property Graphs
In the property graph model, each vertex consists of:
• A unique identifier
• A set of outgoing edges
• A set of incoming edges
• A collection of properties (key-value pairs)
Each edge consists of:
• A unique identifier
• The vertex at which the edge starts (the tail vertex)
