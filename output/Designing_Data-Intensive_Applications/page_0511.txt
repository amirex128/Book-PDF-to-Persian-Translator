CHAPTER 12
The Future of Data Systems
If a thing be ordained to another as to its end, its last end cannot consist in the preservation
of its being. Hence a captain does not intend as a last end, the preservation of the ship
entrusted to him, since a ship is ordained to something else as its end, viz. to navigation.
(Often quoted as: If the highest aim of a captain was the preserve his ship, he would keep it
in port forever.)
—St. Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologica (1265–1274)
So far, this book has been mostly about describing things as they are at present. In
this final chapter, we will shift our perspective toward the future and discuss how
things should be: I will propose some ideas and approaches that, I believe, may funda‐
mentally improve the ways we design and build applications.
Opinions and speculation about the future are of course subjective, and so I will use
the first person in this chapter when writing about my personal opinions. You are
welcome to disagree with them and form your own opinions, but I hope that the
ideas in this chapter will at least be a starting point for a productive discussion and
bring some clarity to concepts that are often confused.
The goal of this book was outlined in Chapter 1: to explore how to create applications
and systems that are reliable, scalable, and maintainable. These themes have run
through all of the chapters: for example, we discussed many fault-tolerance algo‐
rithms that help improve reliability, partitioning to improve scalability, and mecha‐
nisms for evolution and abstraction that improve maintainability. In this chapter we
will bring all of these ideas together, and build on them to envisage the future. Our
goal is to discover how to design applications that are better than the ones of today—
robust, correct, evolvable, and ultimately beneficial to humanity.
