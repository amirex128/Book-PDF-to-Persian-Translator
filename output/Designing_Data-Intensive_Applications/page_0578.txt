lock
A mechanism to ensure that only one
thread, node, or transaction can access
something, and anyone else who wants to
access the same thing must wait until the
lock is released. See “Two-Phase Locking
(2PL)” on page 257 and “The leader and
the lock” on page 301.
log
An append-only file for storing data. A
write-ahead log is used to make a storage
engine resilient against crashes (see “Mak‐
ing B-trees reliable” on page 82), a log-
structured storage engine uses logs as its
primary storage format (see “SSTables
and LSM-Trees” on page 76), a replication
log is used to copy writes from a leader to
followers (see “Leaders and Followers” on
page 152), and an event log can represent
a data stream (see “Partitioned Logs” on
page 446).
materialize
To perform a computation eagerly and
write out its result, as opposed to calculat‐
ing it on demand when requested. See
“Aggregation: Data Cubes and Material‐
ized Views” on page 101 and “Materializa‐
tion of Intermediate State” on page 419.
node
An instance of some software running on
a computer, which communicates with
other nodes via a network in order to
accomplish some task.
normalized
Structured in such a way that there is no
redundancy or duplication. In a normal‐
ized database, when some piece of data
changes, you only need to change it in one
place, not many copies in many different
places. See “Many-to-One and Many-to-
Many Relationships” on page 33.
OLAP
Online analytic processing. Access pattern
characterized by aggregating (e.g., count,
sum, average) over a large number of
records. See “Transaction Processing or
Analytics?” on page 90.
OLTP
Online transaction processing. Access
pattern characterized by fast queries that
read or write a small number of records,
usually indexed by key. See “Transaction
Processing or Analytics?” on page 90.
partitioning
Splitting up a large dataset or computa‐
tion that is too big for a single machine
into smaller parts and spreading them
across several machines. Also known as
sharding. See Chapter 6.
percentile
A way of measuring the distribution of
values by counting how many values are
above or below some threshold. For
example, the 95th percentile response
time during some period is the time t such
that 95% of requests in that period com‐
plete in less than t, and 5% take longer
than t. See “Describing Performance” on
page 13.
primary key
A value (typically a number or a string)
that uniquely identifies a record. In many
applications, primary keys are generated
by the system when a record is created
(e.g., sequentially or randomly); they are
not usually set by users. See also secondary
index.
quorum
The minimum number of nodes that need
to vote on an operation before it can be
considered successful. See “Quorums for
reading and writing” on page 179.
rebalance
To move data or services from one node
to another in order to spread the load
fairly. See “Rebalancing Partitions” on
page 209.
replication
Keeping a copy of the same data on sev‐
eral nodes (replicas) so that it remains
