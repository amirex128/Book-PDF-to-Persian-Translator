For a data structure like a résumé, which is mostly a self-contained document, a JSON
representation can be quite appropriate: see Example 2-1. JSON has the appeal of
being much simpler than XML. Document-oriented databases like MongoDB [9],
RethinkDB [10], CouchDB [11], and Espresso [12] support this data model.
