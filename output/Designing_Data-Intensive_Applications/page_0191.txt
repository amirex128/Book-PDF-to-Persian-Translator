Figure 5-6. Multi-leader replication across multiple datacenters.
Let’s compare how the single-leader and multi-leader configurations fare in a multi-
datacenter deployment:
Performance
In a single-leader configuration, every write must go over the internet to the
datacenter with the leader. This can add significant latency to writes and might
contravene the purpose of having multiple datacenters in the first place. In a
multi-leader configuration, every write can be processed in the local datacenter
and is replicated asynchronously to the other datacenters. Thus, the inter-
datacenter network delay is hidden from users, which means the perceived per‐
formance may be better.
Tolerance of datacenter outages
In a single-leader configuration, if the datacenter with the leader fails, failover
can promote a follower in another datacenter to be leader. In a multi-leader con‐
figuration, each datacenter can continue operating independently of the others,
and replication catches up when the failed datacenter comes back online.
Tolerance of network problems
Traffic between datacenters usually goes over the public internet, which may be
less reliable than the local network within a datacenter. A single-leader configu‐
ration is very sensitive to problems in this inter-datacenter link, because writes
are made synchronously over this link. A multi-leader configuration with asyn‐
chronous replication can usually tolerate network problems better: a temporary
network interruption does not prevent writes being processed.
