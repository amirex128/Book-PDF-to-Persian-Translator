Figure 6-7. Three different ways of routing a request to the right node.
This is a challenging problem, because it is important that all participants agree—
otherwise requests would be sent to the wrong nodes and not handled correctly.
There are protocols for achieving consensus in a distributed system, but they are hard
to implement correctly (see Chapter 9).
Many distributed data systems rely on a separate coordination service such as Zoo‐
Keeper to keep track of this cluster metadata, as illustrated in Figure 6-8. Each node
registers itself in ZooKeeper, and ZooKeeper maintains the authoritative mapping of
partitions to nodes. Other actors, such as the routing tier or the partitioning-aware
client, can subscribe to this information in ZooKeeper. Whenever a partition changes
ownership, or a node is added or removed, ZooKeeper notifies the routing tier so that
it can keep its routing information up to date.
