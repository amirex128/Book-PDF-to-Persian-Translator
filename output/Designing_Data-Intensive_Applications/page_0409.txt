Overview of Chapters
We will start in Chapter 10 by examining batch-oriented dataflow systems such as
MapReduce, and see how they give us good tools and principles for building large-
scale data systems. In Chapter 11 we will take those ideas and apply them to data
streams, which allow us to do the same kinds of things with lower delays. Chapter 12
concludes the book by exploring ideas about how we might use these tools to build
reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications in the future.
