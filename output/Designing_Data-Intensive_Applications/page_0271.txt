ix. In PostgreSQL you can do this more elegantly using range types, but they are not widely supported in
other databases.
More examples of write skew
Write skew may seem like an esoteric issue at first, but once you’re aware of it, you
may notice more situations in which it can occur. Here are some more examples:
Meeting room booking system
Say you want to enforce that there cannot be two bookings for the same meeting
room at the same time [43]. When someone wants to make a booking, you first
check for any conflicting bookings (i.e., bookings for the same room with an
overlapping time range), and if none are found, you create the meeting (see
Example 7-2).ix
Example 7-2. A meeting room booking system tries to avoid double-booking (not
safe under snapshot isolation)
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
-- Check for any existing bookings that overlap with the period of noon-1pm
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bookings
  WHERE room_id = 123 AND
    end_time > '2015-01-01 12:00' AND start_time < '2015-01-01 13:00';
-- If the previous query returned zero:
INSERT INTO bookings
  (room_id, start_time, end_time, user_id)
  VALUES (123, '2015-01-01 12:00', '2015-01-01 13:00', 666);
COMMIT;
Unfortunately, snapshot isolation does not prevent another user from concur‐
rently inserting a conflicting meeting. In order to guarantee you won’t get sched‐
uling conflicts, you once again need serializable isolation.
Multiplayer game
In Example 7-1, we used a lock to prevent lost updates (that is, making sure that
two players can’t move the same figure at the same time). However, the lock
doesn’t prevent players from moving two different figures to the same position
on the board or potentially making some other move that violates the rules of the
game. Depending on the kind of rule you are enforcing, you might be able to use
a unique constraint, but otherwise you’re vulnerable to write skew.
