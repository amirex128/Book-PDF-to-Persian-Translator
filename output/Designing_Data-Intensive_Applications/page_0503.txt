two join inputs may in fact be the same stream (a self-join) if you want to find
related events within that one stream.
Stream-table joins
One input stream consists of activity events, while the other is a database change‐
log. The changelog keeps a local copy of the database up to date. For each activity
event, the join operator queries the database and outputs an enriched activity
event.
Table-table joins
Both input streams are database changelogs. In this case, every change on one
side is joined with the latest state of the other side. The result is a stream of
changes to the materialized view of the join between the two tables.
Finally, we discussed techniques for achieving fault tolerance and exactly-once
semantics in a stream processor. As with batch processing, we need to discard the
partial output of any failed tasks. However, since a stream process is long-running
and produces output continuously, we can’t simply discard all output. Instead, a
finer-grained recovery mechanism can be used, based on microbatching, checkpoint‐
ing, transactions, or idempotent writes.
