PART II
Distributed Data
For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature
cannot be fooled.
—Richard Feynman, Rogers Commission Report (1986)
In Part I of this book, we discussed aspects of data systems that apply when data is
stored on a single machine. Now, in Part II, we move up a level and ask: what hap‐
pens if multiple machines are involved in storage and retrieval of data?
There are various reasons why you might want to distribute a database across multi‐
ple machines:
Scalability
If your data volume, read load, or write load grows bigger than a single machine
can handle, you can potentially spread the load across multiple machines.
Fault tolerance/high availability
If your application needs to continue working even if one machine (or several
machines, or the network, or an entire datacenter) goes down, you can use multi‐
ple machines to give you redundancy. When one fails, another one can take over.
Latency
If you have users around the world, you might want to have servers at various
locations worldwide so that each user can be served from a datacenter that is geo‐
graphically close to them. That avoids the users having to wait for network pack‐
ets to travel halfway around the world.
