Thrift and Protocol Buffers
Apache Thrift [15] and Protocol Buffers (protobuf) [16] are binary encoding libraries
that are based on the same principle. Protocol Buffers was originally developed at
Google, Thrift was originally developed at Facebook, and both were made open
source in 2007â€“08 [17].
Both Thrift and Protocol Buffers require a schema for any data that is encoded. To
encode the data in Example 4-1 in Thrift, you would describe the schema in the
Thrift interface definition language (IDL) like this:
struct Person {
  1: required string       userName,
  2: optional i64          favoriteNumber,
  3: optional list<string> interests
}
