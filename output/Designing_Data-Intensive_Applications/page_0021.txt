Several more people have been invaluable to the writing of this book by reviewing
drafts and providing feedback. For these contributions I am particularly indebted to
Raul Agepati, Tyler Akidau, Mattias Andersson, Sasha Baranov, Veena Basavaraj,
David Beyer, Jim Brikman, Paul Carey, Raul Castro Fernandez, Joseph Chow, Derek
Elkins, Sam Elliott, Alexander Gallego, Mark Grover, Stu Halloway, Heidi Howard,
Nicola Kleppmann, Stefan Kruppa, Bjorn Madsen, Sander Mak, Stefan Podkowinski,
Phil Potter, Hamid Ramazani, Sam Stokes, and Ben Summers. Of course, I take all
responsibility for any remaining errors or unpalatable opinions in this book.
For helping this book become real, and for their patience with my slow writing and
unusual requests, I am grateful to my editors Marie Beaugureau, Mike Loukides, Ann
Spencer, and all the team at O’Reilly. For helping find the right words, I thank Rachel
Head. For giving me the time and freedom to write in spite of other work commit‐
ments, I thank Alastair Beresford, Susan Goodhue, Neha Narkhede, and Kevin Scott.
Very special thanks are due to Shabbir Diwan and Edie Freedman, who illustrated
with great care the maps that accompany the chapters. It’s wonderful that they took
on the unconventional idea of creating maps, and made them so beautiful and com‐
pelling.
Finally, my love goes to my family and friends, without whom I would not have been
able to get through this writing process that has taken almost four years. You’re the
best.
