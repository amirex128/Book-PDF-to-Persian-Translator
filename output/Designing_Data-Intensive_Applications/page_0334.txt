theory. (In practice, if a bad configuration change is rolled out to all nodes, that will
still bring a distributed system to its knees.)
This chapter has been all about problems, and has given us a bleak outlook. In the
next chapter we will move on to solutions, and discuss some algorithms that have
been designed to cope with all the problems in distributed systems.
