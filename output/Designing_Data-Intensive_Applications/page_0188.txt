There is a causal dependency between those two sentences: Mrs. Cake heard Mr.
Poonsâ€™s question and answered it.
Now, imagine a third person is listening to this conversation through followers. The
things said by Mrs. Cake go through a follower with little lag, but the things said by
Mr. Poons have a longer replication lag (see Figure 5-5). This observer would hear
the following:
Mrs. Cake
About ten seconds usually, Mr. Poons.
Mr. Poons
How far into the future can you see, Mrs. Cake?
To the observer it looks as though Mrs. Cake is answering the question before Mr.
Poons has even asked it. Such psychic powers are impressive, but very confusing [25].
Figure 5-5. If some partitions are replicated slower than others, an observer may see the
answer before they see the question.
Preventing this kind of anomaly requires another type of guarantee: consistent prefix
reads [23]. This guarantee says that if a sequence of writes happens in a certain order,
then anyone reading those writes will see them appear in the same order.
This is a particular problem in partitioned (sharded) databases, which we will discuss
in Chapter 6. If the database always applies writes in the same order, reads always see
a consistent prefix, so this anomaly cannot happen. However, in many distributed
