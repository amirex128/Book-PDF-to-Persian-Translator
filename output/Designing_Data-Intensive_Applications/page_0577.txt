fault-tolerant
Able to recover automatically if some‐
thing goes wrong (e.g., if a machine
crashes or a network link fails). See “Reli‐
ability” on page 6.
flow control
See backpressure.
follower
A replica that does not directly accept any
writes from clients, but only processes
data changes that it receives from a leader.
Also known as a secondary, slave, read
replica, or hot standby. See “Leaders and
Followers” on page 152.
full-text search
Searching text by arbitrary keywords,
often with additional features such as
matching similarly spelled words or syno‐
nyms. A full-text index is a kind of secon‐
dary index that supports such queries. See
“Full-text search and fuzzy indexes” on
page 88.
graph
A data structure consisting of vertices
(things that you can refer to, also known
as nodes or entities) and edges (connec‐
tions from one vertex to another, also
known as relationships or arcs). See
“Graph-Like Data Models” on page 49.
hash
A function that turns an input into a
random-looking number. The same input
always returns the same number as out‐
put. Two different inputs are very likely to
have two different numbers as output,
although it is possible that two different
inputs produce the same output (this is
called a collision). See “Partitioning by
Hash of Key” on page 203.
idempotent
Describing an operation that can be safely
retried; if it is executed more than once, it
has the same effect as if it was only exe‐
cuted once. See “Idempotence” on page
478.
index
A data structure that lets you efficiently
search for all records that have a particu‐
lar value in a particular field. See “Data
Structures That Power Your Database” on
page 70.
isolation
In the context of transactions, describing
the degree to which concurrently execut‐
ing transactions can interfere with each
other. Serializable isolation provides the
strongest guarantees, but weaker isolation
levels are also used. See “Isolation” on
page 225.
join
To bring together records that have some‐
thing in common. Most commonly used
in the case where one record has a refer‐
ence to another (a foreign key, a docu‐
ment reference, an edge in a graph) and a
query needs to get the record that the ref‐
erence points to. See “Many-to-One and
Many-to-Many Relationships” on page 33
and “Reduce-Side Joins and Grouping” on
page 403.
leader
When data or a service is replicated across
several nodes, the leader is the designated
replica that is allowed to make changes. A
leader may be elected through some pro‐
tocol, or manually chosen by an adminis‐
trator. Also known as the primary or
master. See “Leaders and Followers” on
page 152.
linearizable
Behaving as if there was only a single copy
of data in the system, which is updated by
atomic operations. See “Linearizability”
on page 324.
locality
A performance optimization: putting sev‐
eral pieces of data in the same place if they
are frequently needed at the same time.
See “Data locality for queries” on page 41.
