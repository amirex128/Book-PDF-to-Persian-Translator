A data warehouse, by contrast, is a separate database that analysts can query to their
hearts’ content, without affecting OLTP operations [48]. The data warehouse con‐
tains a read-only copy of the data in all the various OLTP systems in the company.
Data is extracted from OLTP databases (using either a periodic data dump or a con‐
tinuous stream of updates), transformed into an analysis-friendly schema, cleaned
up, and then loaded into the data warehouse. This process of getting data into the
warehouse is known as Extract–Transform–Load (ETL) and is illustrated in
Figure 3-8.

Data warehouses now exist in almost all large enterprises, but in small companies
they are almost unheard of. This is probably because most small companies don’t
have so many different OLTP systems, and most small companies have a small
amount of data—small enough that it can be queried in a conventional SQL database,
or even analyzed in a spreadsheet. In a large company, a lot of heavy lifting is
required to do something that is simple in a small company.
A big advantage of using a separate data warehouse, rather than querying OLTP sys‐
tems directly for analytics, is that the data warehouse can be optimized for analytic
access patterns. It turns out that the indexing algorithms discussed in the first half of
this chapter work well for OLTP, but are not very good at answering analytic queries.
