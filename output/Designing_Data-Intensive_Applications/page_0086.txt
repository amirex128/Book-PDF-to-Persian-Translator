DNA molecule) and matching it against a large database of strings that are simi‐
lar, but not identical. None of the databases described here can handle this kind
of usage, which is why researchers have written specialized genome database
software like GenBank [48].
• Particle physicists have been doing Big Data–style large-scale data analysis for
decades, and projects like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) now work with hun‐
dreds of petabytes! At such a scale custom solutions are required to stop the
hardware cost from spiraling out of control [49].
• Full-text search is arguably a kind of data model that is frequently used alongside
databases. Information retrieval is a large specialist subject that we won’t cover in
great detail in this book, but we’ll touch on search indexes in Chapter 3 and
Part III.
We have to leave it there for now. In the next chapter we will discuss some of the
trade-offs that come into play when implementing the data models described in this
chapter.
