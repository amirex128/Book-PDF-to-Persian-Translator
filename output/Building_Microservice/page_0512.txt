BFFs for Desktop Web and Beyond
You can think of BFFs as just having a use in solving the constraints of mobile devi‐
ces. The desktop web experience is typically delivered on more powerful devices with
better connectivity, where the cost of making multiple downstream calls is managea‐
ble. This can allow your web application to make multiple calls directly to down‐
stream services without the need for a BFF.
I have seen situations, though, in which the use of a BFF for the web too can be use‐
ful. When you are generating a larger portion of the web UI on the server side (e.g.,
using server-side templating), a BFF is the obvious place where this can be done. This
approach can also simplify caching somewhat, as you can place a reverse proxy in
front of the BFF, allowing you to cache the results of aggregated calls.
