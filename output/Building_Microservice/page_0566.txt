actually speak with people on the ground. In fact, I’d suggest that defining the right
fitness functions will require close collaboration.
Architecture in a Stream-Aligned Organization
In Chapter 15, we looked at how modern software delivery organizations are shifting
toward a more stream-aligned model in which autonomous independent teams focus
on the end-to-end delivery of functionality, with their priorities being product
driven. We also talked about cross-cutting teams—enabling teams that support
stream-aligned teams. Where does the architect fit into this world? Well, sometimes
the scope of a stream-aligned team is complex enough to require a dedicated archi‐
tect (here again we often see a blurring of the lines between the traditional technical
lead and architect roles). In many cases, though, architects are asked to work across
multiple teams.
Many of the responsibilities of the architect can be seen as enabling responsibilities—
clearly communicating technical vision, understanding challenges as they emerge,
and helping adapt the technical vision accordingly. The architect helps connect peo‐
ple, keeping an eye on the bigger picture and helping teams understand how what
they are doing fits into the greater whole. This fits neatly into the idea of an architect
being part of an enabling team, as we see in Figure 16-4. Such an enabling team could
consist of a mix of people—perhaps folks who are dedicated to the team full-time,
and others who pitch in to help from time to time.

A model I greatly favor is to have a small number of dedicated architects in this team
(perhaps just one or two people in many cases), but having this team augmented over
time with technologists from each delivery team—the technical leads of each team at
a minimum. The architect is responsible for making sure the group works. This
