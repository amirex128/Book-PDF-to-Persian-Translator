5 We really can’t. I’ve tried!
Figure 6-7. Triggering a rollback of the entire saga
Because we cannot always cleanly revert a transaction, we say that these compensat‐
ing transactions are semantic rollbacks. We cannot always clean up everything, but we
do enough for the context of our saga. As an example, one of our steps may have
involved sending an email to a customer to tell them their order was on the way. If we
decide to roll that back, we can’t unsend an email!5 Instead, our compensating trans‐
action could cause a second email to be sent to the customer, informing them that
there was a problem with the order and it has canceled.
It is totally appropriate for information related to the rollback to persist in the sys‐
tem. In fact, this may be very important information. You may want to keep a record
in the Order service for this aborted order, along with information about what hap‐
pened, for a whole host of reasons.
