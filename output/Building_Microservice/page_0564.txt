A Real-World Example
An old colleague of mine, Evan Bottcher, developed the diagram shown in
Figure 16-3 in the course of working with one of his clients. The figure shows the
interplay of goals, principles, and practices in a very clear format. Over the course of
a couple of years, the practices on the far right will change fairly regularly, whereas
the principles remain fairly static. A diagram such as this can be printed nicely on a
single sheet of paper and shared, and each idea is simple enough for the average
developer to remember. There is, of course, more detail behind each point here, but
being able to articulate this in summary form is very useful.
Figure 16-3. A real-world example of principles and practices
It makes sense to have documentation supporting some of these items, and even bet‐
ter is having working code that shows how these practices can be implemented. In
“The Platform” on page 506, we looked at how the creation of a common set of tools
can make it easy for developers to do the right thing—ideally, the platform should
make following these practices as easy as possible, and as the practices change, the
platform should change accordingly.
