An enabling team can help identify problems that would be better fixed outside of the
teams as well. Consider a scenario in which each team was finding it painful to spin
up databases with test data in them. Each team had worked around this issue in dif‐
ferent ways, but the issue was never important enough for any team to fix it properly.
But then we look across multiple teams and find that many of them might benefit
from a proper solution to the problem, and it suddenly becomes obvious that it needs
to be addressed.
Communities of Practice
A community of practice (CoP) is a cross-cutting group that fosters sharing and learn‐
ing between peers. When done well, communities of practice are a fantastic way to
create an organization in which people are able to continually learn and grow. In her
excellent book on the subject, Building Successful Communities of Practice,11 Emily
Webber writes:
Communities of practice create the right environment for social learning, experiential
learning and a rounded curriculum, leading to accelerated learning for members...It
can encourage a learning culture where people seek better ways to do things, rather
than only using existing models.
