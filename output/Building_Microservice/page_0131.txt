Figure 4-8. The Chart microservice sends a request to Inventory asking for stock levels
Retrieving data from other microservices like this is a common use case for a request-
response call. Sometimes, though, you just need to make sure something gets done.
In Figure 4-9, the Warehouse microservice is sent a request from Order Processor
asking it to reserve stock. The Order Processor just needs to know that stock has
been successfully reserved before it can carry on with taking payment. If the stock
can’t be reserved—perhaps because an item is no longer available—then the payment
can be cancelled. Using request-response calls in situations like this where calls need
to be completed in a certain order is commonplace.
