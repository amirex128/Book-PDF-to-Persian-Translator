Figure 2-14. A shared model between the finance department and the warehouse
To be able to work out the valuation of the company, though, the finance employees
need information about the stock we hold. The stock item then becomes a shared
model between the two contexts. However, note that we don’t need to blindly expose
everything about the stock item from the warehouse context. In Figure 2-15, we see
how Stock Item inside the warehouse bounded context contains references to the
shelf locations, but the shared representation contains only a count. So there is the
internal-only representation and the external representation we expose. Often, when
you have different internal and external representations, it may be beneficial to name
them differently to avoid confusion—in this situation, one approach could be to call
the shared Stock Item a Stock Count instead.

Shared models
We can also have concepts that appear in more than one bounded context. In
Figure 2-14 we saw that a customer exists in both locations. What does this mean? Is
the customer copied? The way to think about this is that conceptually, both finance
