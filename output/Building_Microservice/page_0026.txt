And finally, hello to Jason Isaacs.
I wrote the bulk of this book throughout the whole of 2020 and in the first half of
2021. I used Visual Studio Code on macOS for most of the writing, although on rare
occasions I also used Working Copy on iOS. OmniGraffle was used to create all the
diagrams in the book. AsciiDoc was used to format the book and on the whole was
excellent, with O’Reilly’s Atlas toolchain doing the magic of making a book appear on
the other side.
