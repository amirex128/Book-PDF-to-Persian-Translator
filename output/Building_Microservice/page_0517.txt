CHAPTER 15
Organizational Structures
While much of the book so far has focused on the technical challenges in moving
toward a fine-grained architecture, we’ve also looked at the interplay between our
microservice architecture and how we organize our teams. In “Toward Stream-
Aligned Teams” on page 459, we looked at the concept of stream-aligned teams,
which have end-to-end responsibility for delivery of user-facing functionality, and at
how microservices can help make such team structures a reality.
We now need to flesh out these ideas and look at other organizational considerations.
As we’ll see, if you want to get the most out of microservices, you ignore your com‐
pany’s organization chart at your peril!
Loosely Coupled Organizations
Throughout the book, I’ve made the case for a loosely coupled architecture and
argued that alignment with more autonomous, loosely coupled, stream-aligned teams
is likely going to deliver the best outcomes. A shift to a microservice architecture
without a shift in organizational structure will blunt the usefulness of microservices—
you may end up paying the (considerable) cost for the architectural change, without
getting the return on your investment. I’ve written generally about the need to reduce
coordination between teams to help speed up delivery, which in turn enables teams
to make more decisions for themselves. These are ideas we’ll explore more fully in
this chapter, and we’ll flesh out some of these organizational and behavioral shifts
that are required, but before that, I think it’s important to share my vision for what a
loosely coupled organization looks like.
