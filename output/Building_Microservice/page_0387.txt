Months before the breach, the vulnerability in Apache Struts had been identified, and
a new release had been made by the maintainers fixing the issue. Unfortunately,
Equifax hadn’t updated to the new version of the software, despite it being available
for months before the attack. Had Equifax updated this software in a timely manner,
it seems probable that the attack wouldn’t have been possible.
The issue of keeping on top of patching is becoming more complex as we deploy
increasingly complex systems. We need to become more sophisticated in how we
handle this fairly basic concept.
Figure 11-3 shows an example of the layers of infrastructure and software that exist
underneath a typical Kubernetes cluster. If you run all of that infrastructure yourself,
you’re in charge of managing and patching all those layers. How confident are you
that you are up to date with your patching? Obviously, if you can offload some of this
work to a public cloud provider, you can offload part of this burden too.
