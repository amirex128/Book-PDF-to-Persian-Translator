Communication Styles
We summarized the main forms of inter-microservice communication in Chapter 4,
shared again in Figure A-1. This isn’t meant to be a universal model but is intended
to just give an overview of the different types of communication that are most
common.
Figure A-1. Different styles of inter-microservice communication along with example
implementing technologies
With request-response communication, a microservice sends a request to a down‐
stream microservice and expects a response. With synchronous request-response, we
would expect the response to come back to the microservice instance that sent the
request. With asynchronous request-response, it’s possible for the response to come
back to a different instance of the upstream microservices.
With event-driven communication, a microservice emits an event, and other micro‐
services, if they are interested in that event, can react to it. Events are just statements
of fact—information that is shared about something that has happened. With event-
driven communication, a microservice doesn’t tell another microservice what to do;
it just shares events. It’s up to downstream microservices to make a judgment call as
to what they do with that information. Event-driven communication is by definition
asynchronous in nature.
One microservice may communicate over more than one protocol. For example, in
Figure A-2 we see a Shipping microservice providing a REST interface for request-
response interaction, which also fires events when changes are made.
