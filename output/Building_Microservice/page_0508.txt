A variation is to look for opportunities to use the same BFF for more than one type of
client, albeit for the same type of user interface. SoundCloud’s Listener application
allows people to listen to content on their Android or iOS devices. SoundCloud uses
a single BFF for both Android and iOS, as shown in Figure 14-13.

My main concern with this second model is that the more types of clients you have
using a single BFF, the more temptation there may be for the BFF to become bloated
by handling multiple concerns. The key thing to understand here, though, is that
even when clients share a BFF, it is for the same class of user interface—so while
SoundCloud’s native Listener applications for iOS and Android use the same BFF,
other native applications would use different BFFs. I’m more relaxed about using this
model if the same team owns both the Android and iOS applications and owns the
BFF too—if these applications are maintained by different teams, I’m more inclined
to recommend the more strict model. So you can see your organizational structure as
being one of the main drivers for deciding which model makes the most sense (Con‐
way’s law wins again).
