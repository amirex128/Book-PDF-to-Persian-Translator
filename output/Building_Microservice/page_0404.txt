Figure 11-7. Using a gateway to handle SSO
However, we still need to solve the problem of how the downstream service receives
information about principals, such as their username or what roles they play. If
you’re using HTTP, you could configure your gateway to populate headers with this
information. Shibboleth is one tool that can do this for you, and I’ve seen it used with
the Apache web server to handle integration with SAML-based identity providers, to
great effect. An alternative, which we’ll look at in more detail shortly, is to create a
JSON Web Token (JWT) containing all the information about the principal; this has
a number of benefits, including being something we can more easily pass from
microservice to microservice.
Another consideration with using a single sign-on gateway is that if we have decided
to offload responsibility for authentication to a gateway, it can be harder to reason
about how a microservice behaves when looking at it in isolation. Remember in
Chapter 9 when we explored some of the challenges of reproducing production-like
environments? If you decide to use a gateway, make sure your developers can launch
their services behind one without too much work.
