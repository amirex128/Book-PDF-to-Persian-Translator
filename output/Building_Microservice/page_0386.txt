one of the instances if that is what becomes compromised. Moreover, with more spe‐
cific credentials it can be easier to find out from where and how the credential was
obtained. There are obviously other benefits that come from having a uniquely iden‐
tifiable username for a microservice instance here; it might be easier to track down
which instance caused an expensive query, for example.

further limiting access
As we’ve already covered, managing fine-grained credentials at scale can be complex,
and if you did want to adopt an approach like this, some form of automation would
be essential—secret stores like Vault come to mind as perfect ways to implement
schemes like this.
Patching
The 2017 Equifax data breach is a great example of the importance of patching. A
known vulnerability in Apache Struts was used to gain unauthorized access to data
held by Equifax. Because Equifax is a credit bureau, this information was especially
sensitive. In the end it was found that the data of more than 160 million people was
compromised in the breach. Equifax ended up having to pay a $700 million
settlement.
