Final Words
Microservice architectures give you more options, and more decisions to make. Mak‐
ing decisions in this world is a far more common activity than in simpler, monolithic
systems. You won’t get all of these decisions right, I can guarantee that. So, knowing
you are going to get some things wrong, what are your options? Well, I would suggest
finding ways to make each decision small in scope; that way, if you get one wrong,
you impact only a small part of your system. Learn to embrace the concept of evolu‐
tionary architecture, in which your system bends and flexes and changes over time as
you learn new things. Think not of big-bang rewrites, but instead of a series of
changes made to your system over time to keep it supple.
I hope by now I’ve shared with you enough information and experiences to help you
decide whether microservices are for you. If they are, I hope you think of this as a
journey, not a destination. Go incrementally. Break your system apart piece by piece,
learning as you go. And get used to it: in many ways, the discipline to continually
change and evolve our systems is a far more important lesson to learn than any other
I have shared with you through this book. Change is inevitable. Embrace it.
