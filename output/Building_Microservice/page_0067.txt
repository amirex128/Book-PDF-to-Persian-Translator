8 This concept is similar to the domain application protocol, which defines the rules by which components
interact in a REST-based system.

Domain Coupling
Domain coupling describes a situation in which one microservice needs to interact
with another microservice, because the first microservice needs to make use of the
functionality that the other microservice provides.8
In Figure 2-2, we see part of how orders for CDs are managed inside MusicCorp. In
this example, Order Processor calls the Warehouse microservice to reserve stock,
and the Payment microservice to take payment. The Order Processor is therefore
dependent on, and coupled to, the Warehouse and Payment microservices for this
operation. We see no such coupling between Warehouse and Payment, though, as they
donâ€™t interact.
