Pattern: Widget-Based Decomposition
With widget-based decomposition, a screen in a graphical interface contains widgets
that can be independently changed. In Figure 14-5, we see an example of Music
Corp’s frontend, with two widgets providing the UI functionality for the shopping
basket and the recommendations.
Figure 14-5. Basket and recommendation widgets being used on MusicCorp
The recommendation widget for MusicCorp pulls back a carousel of recommenda‐
tions that can be cycled through and filtered. As we see in Figure 14-6, when the user
interacts with the recommendation widget—cycling through to the next set of recom‐
mendations, for example, or adding items to their wishlist—it may result in calls
being made to backing microservices, perhaps in this case the Recommendations and
Wishlist microservices. This could align well with a team that owns both those back‐
ing microservices and the component itself.
