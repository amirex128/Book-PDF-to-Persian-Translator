To help you find the right balance when it comes to security of your microservice
architecture, we’ll cover the following topics:
Core principles
Fundamental concepts that are useful to embrace when looking to build more
secure software
The five functions of cybersecurity
Identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover—an overview of the five key func‐
tion areas for application security
Foundations of application security
Some specific fundamental concepts of application security and how they apply
to microservices, including credentials and secrets, patching, backups, and
rebuild
Implicit trust versus zero trust
Different approaches for trust in our microservice environment and how this
impacts security-related activities
Securing data
How we protect data as it travels over networks and as it rests on disk
Authentication and authorization
How single sign-on (SSO) works in a microservice architecture, centralized ver‐
sus decentralized authorization models, and the role of JWT tokens as part of
this
Core Principles
Often when the topic of microservice security comes up, people want to start talking
about reasonably sophisticated technological issues like the use of JWT tokens or the
need for mutual TLS (topics we will explore later in this chapter). However, the prob‐
lem with security is that you’re only as secure as your least secure aspect. To use an
analogy, if you’re looking to secure your home, it would be a mistake to focus all your
efforts on having a front door that is pick resistant, with lights and cameras to deter
malicious parties, if you leave your back door open.
Thus, there are some fundamental aspects of application security that we need to look
at, however briefly, to highlight the plethora of issues you need to be aware of. We
will look at how these core issues are made more (or less) complex in the context of
microservices, but they should also be generally applicable to software development
as a whole. For those of you who want to jump ahead to all that “good stuff,” please
just make sure you aren’t focusing too much on securing your front door while leav‐
ing the back door open.
