Limiting scope
Limiting the scope of credentials is core to the idea of embracing the principle of least
privilege. This can apply across all forms of credentials, but limiting the scope of what
a given set of credentials gives you access to can be incredibly useful. For example, in
Figure 11-1, each instance of the Inventory microservice is given the same username
and password for the supporting database. We also provide read-only access to the
supporting Debezium process that will be used to read data and send it out via Kafka
as part of an existing ETL process. If the username and password for the microservi‐
ces are compromised, an external party could theoretically gain read and write access
to the database. If they gained access to the Debezium credentials, though, they’d
only have read-only access.
Figure 11-1. Limiting scope of credentials to limit the impact of misuse
Limiting scope can apply in terms of both what the set of credentials can access and
also who has access to that set of credentials. In Figure 11-2, we’ve changed things
such that each instance of Inventory gets a different set of credentials. This means
that we could rotate each credential independently, or just revoke the credential for
