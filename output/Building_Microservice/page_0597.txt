reaction to an HTTP call, or a message
being received.
governance
Agreeing how things should be done, and
making sure they are done that way.
graceful extensibility
How well we deal with a situation that is
unexpected.
GraphQL
A protocol that allows the client to issue
custom queries that can result in calls
being made to multiple downstream
microservices. Useful to aid call aggrega‐
tion and filtering for external clients
without requiring the use of BFF or API
gateways.
horizontal duplication
Scaling a system by having multiple copies
of a thing.
idempotency
The property of a function where even if it
is called multiple times, the result is the
same. Useful to allow operations on
microservices to be safely retried.
independent deployability
The ability to make a change to a micro‐
service and deploy it into production
without having to change or deploy any‐
thing else.
information hiding
An approach wherein all information is
hidden by default inside a boundary, and
only the bare minimum is exposed to sat‐
isfy external consumers.
infrastructure as code
Modeling your infrastructure in code
form, allowing for infrastructure manage‐
ment to be automated and the code to be
version controlled.
JSON Web Token
A standard for creating a JSON data
structure that can be optionally encrypted.
It is typically used for transmitting infor‐
mation about authenticated principals.
Kubernetes
An open source platform that manages
container 
workloads 
across 
multiple
underlying machines.
library
A set of code that is packaged in such a
way that it can be reused in multiple pro‐
grams.
lockstep deployment
The need to deploy two or more things at
the same time, because a change has
occurred that requires it. The opposite of
independent deployability. In general,
avoid.
message
Something sent to one or more down‐
stream microservices via an asynchronous
communication mechanism like a broker.
Could contain a variety of payloads, such
as a request, response, or an event.
message broker
Dedicated software that manages the
asynchronous communication between
processes, typically providing capabilities
like guaranteed delivery (for some defini‐
tion of the word guaranteed).
microservice
An independently deployable service that
communicates with other microservices
via one or more communication proto‐
cols.
monorepo
A single repository that contains all the
source code for all your microservices.
multirepo
An approach in which each microservice
has its own source code repository.
orchestration
A style of saga wherein a central unit (aka
the orchestrator) manages the operation
of other microservices to carry out a busi‐
ness process.
