Figure 3-6. A join operation in the monolithic database
In our new microservice-based world, our new Finance microservice has the respon‐
sibility of generating the bestsellers report but doesn’t have the album data locally. So
it will need to fetch this data from our new Catalog microservice, as shown in
Figure 3-7. When generating the report, the Finance microservice first queries the
Ledger table, extracting the list of best-selling SKUs for the last month. At this point,
the only information we have locally is a list of SKUs and the number of copies sold
for each SKU.
