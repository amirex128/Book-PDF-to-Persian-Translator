CHAPTER 3
Splitting the Monolith
Many of you reading this book likely don’t have a blank slate on which to design your
system, and even if you did, starting with microservices might not be a great idea, for
reasons we explored in Chapter 1. Many of you will already have an existing system,
perhaps some form of monolithic architecture, which you are looking to migrate to a
microservice architecture.
In this chapter I’ll outline some first steps, patterns, and general tips to help you navi‐
gate the transition to a microservice architecture.
Have a Goal
Microservices are not the goal. You don’t “win” by having microservices. Adopting a
microservice architecture should be a conscious decision, one based on rational deci‐
sion making. You should be thinking of migrating to a microservice architecture only
if you can’t find any easier way to move toward your end goal with your current
architecture.
Without a clear understanding as to what you are trying to achieve, you could fall
into the trap of confusing activity with outcome. I’ve seen teams obsessed with creat‐
ing microservices without ever asking why. This is problematic in the extreme given
the new sources of complexity that microservices can introduce.
Fixating on microservices rather than on the end goal also means you will likely stop
thinking of other ways in which you might bring about the change you are looking
for. For example, microservices can help you scale your system, but there are often a
number of alternative scaling techniques that should be looked at first. Spinning up a
few more copies of your existing monolithic system behind a load balancer may well
help you scale your system much more effectively than going through a complex and
lengthy decomposition to microservices.
