Technology
The need to make use of different technology can also be a factor in terms of finding
a boundary. You can accommodate different databases in a single running microser‐
vice, but if you want to mix different runtime models, you may face a challenge. If
you determine that part of your functionality needs to be implemented in a runtime
like Rust, which enables you to eke out additional performance improvements, that
ends up being a major forcing factor.
Of course, we have to be aware of where this can drive us if adopted as a general
means of decomposition. The classic three-tiered architecture that we discussed in
the opening chapter, and that we show again in Figure 2-18, is an example of related
technology being grouped together. As we’ve already explored, this is often a less
than ideal architecture.
