Test Scope
In his book Succeeding with Agile,2 Mike Cohn outlines a model called the test pyra‐
mid to help explain what types of automated tests are needed. The pyramid helps us
think about not only the scope of the tests, but also the proportions of the different
types of tests we should aim for. Cohn’s original model split automated tests into unit
tests, service tests, and UI tests, as illustrated in Figure 9-2.

The key thing to take away when reading the pyramid is that as we go up the pyra‐
mid, the test scope increases, as does our confidence that the functionality being
tested works. On the other hand, the feedback cycle time increases as the tests take
longer to run, and when a test fails, it can be harder to determine which functionality
has broken. As we go down the pyramid, in general the tests become much faster, so
we get much faster feedback cycles. We find broken functionality faster, our continu‐
ous integration builds are faster, and we are less likely to move on to a new task
before finding out we have broken something. When those smaller-scoped tests fail,
we also tend to know what broke, often down to the exact line of code—each test is
better isolated, making it easier for us to understand and fix breakages. On the flip
side, we don’t get a lot of confidence that our system as a whole works if we’ve tested
only one line of code!
The problem with this model is that all these terms mean different things to different
people. Service is especially overloaded, and there are many definitions of a unit test
out there. Is a test a unit test if I test only one line of code? I’d say it is. Is it still a unit
test if I test multiple functions or classes? I’d say no, but many would disagree! I tend
