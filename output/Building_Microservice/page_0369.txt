Above all, this is about accepting that not all things are knowable before you hit pro‐
duction. Get good at handling the unknown.
We’ve covered a lot, but there is more to dig into here. If you want to explore the
concepts of observability in more detail, then I recommend Observability Engineering
by Charity Majors, Liz Fong-Jones, and George Miranda.15 I also recommend both
Site Reliability Engineering16 and The Site Reliability Workbook17 as good jumping-off
points for a wider discussion around SLOs, SLIs, and the like. It’s worth noting that
these last two books are very much written from a viewpoint of how things are (or
were) done at Google, and that means these concepts won’t always translate. You
probably aren’t Google and probably don’t have Google-sized problems. That said,
there is still a lot to recommend in these books.
In the next chapter, we’ll take a different, albeit still holistic view of our systems and
consider some of the unique advantages—and challenges—that fine-grained architec‐
tures can provide in the area of security.
