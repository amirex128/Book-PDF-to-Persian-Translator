Cost
It’s highly likely that in the short term at least you’ll see an increase in costs from a
number of factors. Firstly, you’ll likely need to run more things—more processes,
more computers, more network, more storage, and more supporting software (which
will incur additional license fees).
Secondly, any change you introduce into a team or an organization will slow you
down in the short term. It takes time to learn new ideas, and to work out how to use
them effectively. While this is going on, other activities will be impacted. This will
result in either a direct slowdown in delivery of new functionality or the need to add
more people to offset this cost.
In my experience, microservices are a poor choice for an organization primarily con‐
cerned with reducing costs, as a cost-cutting mentality—where IT is seen as a cost
center rather than a profit center—will constantly be a drag on getting the most out
of this architecture. On the other hand, microservices can help you make more
money if you can use these architectures to reach more customers or develop more
functionality in parallel. So are microservices a way to drive more profits? Perhaps.
Are microservices a way to reduce costs? Not so much.
Reporting
With a monolithic system, you typically have a monolithic database. This means that
stakeholders who want to analyze all the data together, often involving large join
operations across data, have a ready-made schema against which to run their reports.
They can just run them directly against the monolithic database, perhaps against a
read replica, as shown in Figure 1-12.
