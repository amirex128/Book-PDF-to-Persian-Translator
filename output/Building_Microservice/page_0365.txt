Easy to Integrate
Getting the right information out of your application architecture and the systems
you run on is vital, and as we’ve already covered, you may need to be extracting more
information than before, and in different formats. Making this process as easy as pos‐
sible is crucial. Initiatives such as OpenTracing have helped in terms of providing
standard APIs that client libraries and platforms can support, making integration and
portability across toolchains easier. Of special interest, as I’ve discussed, is the new
OpenTelemetry initiative, which is being driven by a large number of parties.
Picking tools that support these open standards will ease integration efforts and also
perhaps help make it easier to change vendors later on.
Provide Context
When looking at a piece of information, I need the tool to provide me with as much
context as possible to help me understand what needs to happen next. I really like the
following categorization system for different types of context that I found via a Light‐
step blog post:13
Temporal context
How does this look compared to a minute, hour, day, or month ago?
Relative context
How has this changed in relation to other things in the system?
Relational context
Is something depending on this? Is this depending on something else?
Proportional context
How bad is this? Is it large or small scoped? Who is impacted?
Real-Time
You can’t wait ages for this information. You need it now. Your definition of “now”
can of course vary somewhat, but in the context of your systems, you need informa‐
tion quickly enough that you have a chance of spotting a problem before a user does,
or at the very least of having the information at hand when someone does complain.
In practice, we’re talking about seconds, not minutes or hours.
