Useful Decompositional Patterns
A number of patterns can be useful in helping break apart an existing system. Many
of these are explored in detail in my book Monolith to Microservices;1 rather than
repeat them all here, I will share an overview of some of them to give you an idea of
what is possible.
Strangler Fig Pattern
A technique that has seen frequent use during system rewrites is the strangler fig pat‐
tern, a term coined by Martin Fowler. Inspired by a type of plant, the pattern
describes the process of wrapping an old system with the new system over time,
allowing the new system to take over more and more features of the old system
incrementally.
The approach as shown in Figure 3-5 is straightforward. You intercept calls to the
existing system—in our case the existing monolithic application. If the call to that
piece of functionality is implemented in our new microservice architecture, it is redi‐
rected to the microservice. If the functionality is still provided by the monolith, the
call is allowed to continue to the monolith itself.
