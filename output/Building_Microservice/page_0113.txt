If you want to explore any of the concepts in this chapter in more detail, another
book I have written, Monolith to Microservices (O’Reilly), is a deep dive into this
topic.
Much of this chapter has been somewhat high level in its overview. In the next chap‐
ter, though, we’re going to start getting more technical when we look at how micro‐
services communicate with one another.
