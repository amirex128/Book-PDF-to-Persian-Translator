Saga Failure Modes
With a saga being broken into individual transactions, we need to consider how to
handle failure—or, more specifically, how to recover when a failure happens. The
original saga paper describes two types of recovery: backward recovery and forward
recovery.
Backward recovery involves reverting the failure and cleaning up afterwards—a roll‐
back. For this to work, we need to define compensating actions that allow us to undo
previously committed transactions. Forward recovery allows us to pick up from the
point where the failure occurred and keep processing. For that to work, we need to be
able to retry transactions, which in turn implies that our system is persisting enough
information to allow this retry to take place.
