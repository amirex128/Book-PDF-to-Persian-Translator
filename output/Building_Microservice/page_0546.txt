Figure 15-6. An overview of realestate.com.au’s organizational and team structure and
alignment with architecture
It wasn’t just the delivery organization that was aligned to how the business operated.
This model extended to the architecture too. One example of this was the integration
methods. Within an LOB, all services were free to talk to each other in any way they
saw fit, as decided by the squads who act as their custodians. But communication
between LOBs was mandated to be asynchronous batch, one of the few cast-iron
rules of the very small architecture team. This coarse-grained communication
matched that which existed between the different parts of the business too. By insist‐
ing on it being batch, each LOB had a lot of freedom in how it acted and how it man‐
aged itself. It could afford to take its services down whenever it wanted, knowing that
as long as it could satisfy the batch integration with other parts of the business and its
own business stakeholders, no one would care.
This structure allowed for significant autonomy not only among the teams but also
among the different parts of the business, and the ability to deliver change helped the
company achieve significant success in the local market. This more autonomous
structure also helped grow the company from a handful of services in 2010 to hun‐
dreds by 2014, facilitating the ability to deliver change faster.
Those organizations that are adaptive enough to change not only their system archi‐
tecture but also their organizational structure can reap huge benefits in terms of
improved autonomy of teams and faster time to market for new features and func‐
tionality. REA is just one of a number of organizations that have realized that system
architecture doesn’t exist in a vacuum.
