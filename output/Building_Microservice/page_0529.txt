Figure 15-1. The balance between global consistency and local optimization
Fundamentally, though, with a collective ownership model you’ll nearly always be
forced toward the left end of this spectrum—that is, toward requiring a higher degree
of global consistency. In my experience, organizations that get the most out of micro‐
services are constantly trying to find ways to shift the balance more to the right. That
said, for the best organizations this isn’t something that is set in stone but is more
something that is constantly being evaluated.
The reality is that you cannot perform any balancing unless you are aware, to some
extent, of what is going on across your organization. Even if you push a great deal of
responsibility into the teams themselves, there can still be value in having a function
in your delivery organization that can perform this balancing act.
Enabling Teams
We last looked at enabling teams in “Sharing Specialists” on page 460 in the context
of user interfaces, but they have broader applicability than that. As described in Team
Topologies, these are the teams that work to support our stream-aligned teams.
Wherever our microservice-owning, end-to-end focused stream-aligned teams are
focusing on delivering user-facing functionality, they need help from others to do
their job. When discussing the user interface we talked about the idea of having an
enabling team that can help support other teams in terms of creating effective, con‐
sistent user experiences. As shown in Figure 15-2, we can envision this as enabling
teams working to support multiple stream-aligned teams in some cross-cutting
aspect.
