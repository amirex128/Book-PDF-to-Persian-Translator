Instead, if you want to implement a rollback, you need to implement a compensating
transaction. A compensating transaction is an operation that undoes a previously
committed transaction. To roll back our order fulfillment process, we would trigger
the compensating transaction for each step in our saga that has already been commit‐
ted, as shown in Figure 6-7.
It’s worth calling out the fact that these compensating transactions may not behave
exactly as those of a normal database rollback. A database rollback happens before
the commit, and after the rollback, it is as though the transaction never happened. In
this situation, of course, these transactions did happen. We are creating a new trans‐
action that reverts the changes made by the original transaction, but we can’t roll
back time and make it as though the original transaction didn’t occur.
