Chapter 13, Scaling
In this chapter I outline the four axes of scaling and show how they can be used
in combination to scale a microservice architecture.
Part III, People
Ideas and technology don’t mean anything without the people and organization to
back them up.
Chapter 14, User Interfaces
From moving away from dedicated frontend teams to the use of BFFs and
GraphQL, this chapter explores how microservices and user interfaces can work
together.
Chapter 15, Organizational Structures
This penultimate chapter focuses on how stream-aligned and enabling teams can
work in the context of microservice architectures.
Chapter 16, The Evolutionary Architect
Microservice architectures aren’t static, so your view of system architecture may
need to change—a topic that this chapter explores in depth.
