Preface
Microservices are an approach to distributed systems that promote the use of finely
grained services that can be changed, deployed, and released independently. For
organizations that are moving toward more loosely coupled systems, with autono‐
mous teams delivering user-facing functionality, microservices work incredibly well.
Beyond this, microservices provide us with a huge number of options for building
out systems, giving us a lot of flexibility to ensure our system can change to meet the
needs of the users.
Microservices aren’t without significant downsides, though. As a distributed system,
they bring a host of complexity, much of which may be new even to experienced
developers.
The experiences of people all over the world, along with the emergence of new tech‐
nologies, are having a profound effect on how microservices are used. This book
brings these ideas together, along with concrete, real-world examples, to help you
understand whether microservices are right for you.
Who Should Read This Book
The scope of Building Microservices is broad, as the implications of microservice
architectures are also broad. As such, this book should appeal to people interested in
aspects of design, development, deployment, testing, and maintenance of systems.
Those of you who have already embarked on the journey toward finer-grained archi‐
tectures, whether for a greenfield application or as part of decomposing an existing,
more monolithic system, will find plenty of practical advice to help you. This book
will also help those of you who want to know what all the fuss is about, so that you
can determine whether microservices are right for you.
