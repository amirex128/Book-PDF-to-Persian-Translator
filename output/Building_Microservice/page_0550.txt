those responsibilities are important to you. This can help you see what your skill gaps
might be and think about how to close them. For many, this will be a pretty scary
journey. Just remember that without people on board, any change you might want to
make could be doomed from the start.
Summary
Conway’s law highlights the perils of trying to enforce a system design that doesn’t
match the organization. This points us, for microservices at least, toward a model
where strong ownership of microservices is the norm. Sharing microservices or
attempting to practice collective ownership at scale can often result in us undermin‐
ing the benefits of microservices.
When organization and architecture are not in alignment, we get tension points, as
outlined throughout this chapter. By recognizing the link between the two, we’ll
make sure the system we are trying to build makes sense for the organization we’re
building it for.
If you would like to explore this topic further, in addition to the previously men‐
tioned Team Topologies, I can also thoroughly recommend the talk “Scale, Microser‐
vices and Flow,” by James Lewis,16 from which I gained many insights that helped
shape this chapter. It is well worth a watch if you are interested in delving more
deeply into some of the ideas I have covered in this chapter.
In our next chapter, we will explore in more depth a topic I’ve already touched on—
the role of the architect.
