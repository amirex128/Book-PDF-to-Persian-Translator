ing the downstream microservice to do
something.

during/after an attack.
robustness

when implementing business processes.
serverless

marily for synchronous point-to-point
calls—for example, mutual TLS, service

service-oriented architecture (SOA)

other web pages.
stream-aligned team

long-lived team that will normally be
directly customer focused and cut across

strong ownership
A style of ownership in which parts of the
system are owned by specific teams, and
changes to a particular part of the system
can be made only by the team that owns
it.
sustained adaptability
