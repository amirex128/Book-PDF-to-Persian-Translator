Figure 5-8. The Financial Times Biz Ops tool, which collates information about its
microservices
The Biz Ops tool goes further than most of the similar tools I have seen, however.
The tool calculates what it calls a System Operability Score, as shown in Figure 5-9.
The idea is that there are certain things that services and their teams should do to
ensure the services can be easily operated. This can range from making sure the
teams have provided the correct information in the registry to ensuring the services
have proper health checks. The System Operability Score, once calculated, allows
teams to see at a glance if there are things that need to be fixed.
This is a growing space. In the open source world, Spotify’s Backstage tool offers a
mechanism for building a service catalog like Biz Ops, with a plug-in model to allow
for sophisticated additions, such as being able to trigger the creation of a new micro‐
service or pulling in live information from a Kubernetes cluster. Ambassador’s own
Service Catalog is more narrowly focused on visibility of services in Kubernetes,
which means it might not have as much general appeal as something like the FT’s
