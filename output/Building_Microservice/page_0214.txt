Reordering workflow steps to reduce rollbacks
In Figure 6-7, we could have made our likely rollback scenarios somewhat simpler by
reordering the steps in our original workflow. A simple change would be to award
points only when the order is actually dispatched, as seen in Figure 6-8.
Figure 6-8. Moving steps later in the saga can reduce what has to be rolled back in case
of a failure
In this way we would avoid having to worry about that stage being rolled back if we
were to have a problem while trying to package and send the order. Sometimes you
can simplify your rollback operations just by tweaking how your workflow is carried
out. By pulling forward those steps that are most likely to fail and failing the process
earlier, you avoid having to trigger later compensating transactions, as those steps
werenâ€™t even triggered in the first place.
