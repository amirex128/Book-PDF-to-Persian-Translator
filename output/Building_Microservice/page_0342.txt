customer
One approach that can be useful here is to use correlation IDs—something we first
mentioned in Chapter 6 when discussing sagas. When the first call is made, you gen‐
erate a unique ID that will be used to correlate all subsequent calls related to the
request. In Figure 10-6, we generate this ID in the Gateway, and it is then passed
along as a parameter to all subsequent calls.
Logging of any activity by a microservice caused by this incoming call will be recor‐
ded along with the same correlation ID, which we place in a consistent location in
each log line, as shown in Example 10-2. This makes it easy to extract all logs associ‐
ated with a given correlation ID at a later date.
