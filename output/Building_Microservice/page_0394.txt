Secret
Incredibly sensitive information about individuals that could be accessed by peo‐
ple other than the individual in question only in extremely specific situations.
This includes information about an individual’s health data.
Microservices were then categorized based on the most sensitive data they used and
had to run in a matching environment (zone) with matching controls, as we see in
Figure 11-5. A microservice would have to run in the zone matching the most sensi‐
tive data it made use of. For example, a microservice running in the public zone
could use only public data. On the other hand, a microservice that used public and
private data had to run in the private zone, and a microservice that accessed secret
information always had to run in the secret zone.
Figure 11-5. Deploying microservices into different zones based on the sensitivity of the
data they handle
Microservices within each zone could communicate with each other but were unable
to directly reach across to access data or functionality in the lower, more secure
zones. Microservices in the more secure zones could reach up to access functionality
running in the less secure zones, though.
