works as a load distribution mechanism. This is an example of the competing con‐
sumers pattern we touched on briefly in Chapter 4.
Figure 5-1. A queue allows for one consumer group
With topics, you can have multiple consumer groups. In Figure 5-2, an event repre‐
senting an order being paid for is put onto the Order Status topic. A copy of that
event is received by both the Warehouse microservice and the Notifications micro‐
service, which are in separate consumer groups. Only one instance of each consumer
group will see that event.
At first glance, a queue just looks like a topic with a single consumer group. A large
part of the distinction between the two is that when a message is sent over a queue,
there is knowledge of what the message is being sent to. With a topic, this informa‐
tion is hidden from the sender of the message—the sender is unaware of who (if any‐
one) will end up receiving the message.
Topics are a good fit for event-based collaboration, whereas queues would be more
appropriate for request/response communication. This should be considered as gen‐
eral guidance rather than a strict rule, however.
