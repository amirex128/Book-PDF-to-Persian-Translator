The number of instances you’ll want will depend on the nature of your application—
you’ll need to assess the required redundancy, expected load levels, and the like to
come up with a workable number. You may also need to take into account where
these instances will run. If you have multiple instances of a service for robustness rea‐
sons, you likely want to make sure that these instances aren’t all on the same underly‐
ing hardware. Taken further, this might require that you have different instances
distributed not only across multiple machines but also across different data centers,
to give you protection against a whole data center being made unavailable. This
might lead to a deployment topology like the one in Figure 8-3.
Figure 8-3. Distributing instances across multiple different data centers
This might seem overly cautious—what are the chances of an entire data center being
unavailable? Well, I can’t answer that question for every situation, but at least when
dealing with the main cloud providers, this is absolutely something you have to take
account of. When it comes to something like a managed virtual machine, neither
AWS nor Azure nor Google will give you an SLA for a single machine, nor do they
give you an SLA for a single availability zone (which is the closest equivalent to a data
center for these providers). In practice, this means that any solution you deploy
should be distributed across multiple availability zones.
