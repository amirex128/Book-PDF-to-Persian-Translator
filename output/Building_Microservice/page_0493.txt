Pattern: Page-Based Decomposition
In page-based decomposition, our UI is decomposed into multiple web pages. Differ‐
ent sets of pages can be served from different microservices. In Figure 14-4, we see an
example of this pattern for MusicCorp. Requests for pages in /albums/ are routed
directly to the Albums microservice, which handles serving up those pages, and we do
something similar with /artists/. A common navigation is used to help stitch
together these pages. These microservices in turn might fetch information that is
needed to construct these pages—for example, fetching stock levels from the Inven
tory microservice to show on the UI what items are in stock.
Figure 14-4. The user interface consists of multiple pages, with different groups of pages
served up from different microservices
With this model, a team owning the Albums microservice would be able to render a
full UI end to end, making it easy for the team to understand how its changes would
impact the user.
