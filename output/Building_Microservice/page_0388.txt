If you were to use a managed Kubernetes cluster on one of the main public cloud
vendors, for example, you’d drastically reduce your scope of ownership, as we see in
Figure 11-4.

complexity
Containers throw us an interesting curveball here. We treat a given container
instance as immutable. But a container contains not just our software but also an
operating system. And do you know where that container has come from? Contain‐
ers are based on an image, which in turn can extend other images—are you sure the
base images you are using don’t already have backdoors in them? If you haven’t
changed a container instance in six months, that’s six months worth of operating sys‐
tem patches that haven’t been applied. Keeping on top of this is problematic, which is
why companies like Aqua provide tooling to help you analyze your running produc‐
tion containers so you can understand what issues need to be addressed.
