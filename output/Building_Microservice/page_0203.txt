Still ACID, but Lacking Atomicity?
I want to be clear that we can still use ACID-style transactions when using microser‐
vices. A microservice is free to use an ACID transaction for operations to its own
database, for example. It’s just that the scope of these transactions is reduced to state
change that happens locally within that single microservice. Consider Figure 6-1.
Here, we are keeping track of the process involved in onboarding a new customer to
MusicCorp. We’ve reached the end of the process, which involves changing the Sta
tus of customer 2346 from PENDING to VERIFIED. As the enrollment is now complete,
we also want to remove the matching row from the PendingEnrollments table. With
a single database, this is done in the scope of a single ACID database transaction—
either both of these state changes occur, or neither occurs.
Figure 6-1. Updating two tables in the scope of a single ACID transaction
Compare this with Figure 6-2, where we’re making exactly the same change, but each
change is made in a different database. This means there are two transactions to con‐
sider, each of which could work or fail independently of the other.
