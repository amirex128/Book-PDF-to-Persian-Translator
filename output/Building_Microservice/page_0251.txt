Environments
When you deploy your software, it runs in an environment. Each environment will
typically serve different purposes, and the exact number of environments you might
have will vary greatly based on how you develop software and how your software is
deployed to your end user. Some environments will have production data, while oth‐
ers won’t. Some environments may have all services in them; others might have just a
small number of services, with any nonpresent services replaced with fake ones for
the purposes of testing.
Typically, we think of our software as moving through a number of preproduction
environments, with each one serving some purpose to allow the software to be devel‐
oped and its readiness for production to be tested—we explored this in “Trade-Offs
and Environments” on page 203. From a developer laptop to a continuous integra‐
tion server, an integrated test environment, and beyond—the exact nature and num‐
ber of your environments will depend on a host of factors but will be driven primarily
by how you choose to develop software. In Figure 8-8, we see a pipeline for
MusicCorp’s Catalog microservice. The microservice moves through different envi‐
ronments before it finally gets into a production environment, where our users will
get to use the new software.
