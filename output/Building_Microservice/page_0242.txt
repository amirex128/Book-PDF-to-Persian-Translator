Figure 7-11. A pattern variation in which each team has its own monorepo
For teams practicing collective ownership, this model has a lot of benefits, arguably
providing most of the advantages of a monorepo approach while sidestepping some
of the challenges that occur at larger scale. This halfway house can make a lot of sense
in terms of working within existing organizational ownership boundaries, and it can
somewhat mitigate the concerns about the use of this pattern at larger scale.
Where to use this pattern
Some organizations working at very large scale have found the monorepo approach
to work very well for them. We’ve already mentioned Google and Microsoft, and we
can add Facebook, Twitter, and Uber to the list. These organizations all have one
thing in common—they are big, tech-focused companies that are able to dedicate sig‐
nificant resources to getting the best out of this pattern. Where I see monorepos work
well is at the other end of the spectrum, with smaller numbers of developers and
teams. With 10 to 20 developers, it is easier to manage ownership boundaries and
keep the build process simple with the monorepo approach. Pain points seem to
emerge for organizations in the middle—those with the scale to start hitting issues
that require new tooling or ways of working, but without the spare bandwidth to
invest in these ideas.
