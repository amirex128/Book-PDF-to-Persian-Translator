being made as part of a synchronous call chain, however, it is probably better to fail
fast. This could mean propagating an error up the call chain, or a more subtle degrad‐
ing of functionality.
In the case of AdvertCorp, we wrapped downstream calls to the legacy systems with
circuit breakers, as Figure 12-6 shows. When these circuit breakers blew, we pro‐
grammatically updated the website to show that we couldn’t currently show ads for,
say, turnips. We kept the rest of the website working and clearly communicated to
the customers that there was an issue restricted to one part of our product, all in a
fully automated way.
Figure 12-6. Adding circuit breakers to AdvertCorp
We were able to scope our circuit breakers so that we had one for each of the down‐
stream legacy systems—this lined up well with the fact that we had decided to have
different request worker pools for each downstream service.
If we have this mechanism in place (as with the circuit breakers in our home), we
could use them manually to make it safer to do our work. For example, if we wanted
to take a microservice down as part of routine maintenance, we could manually open
all the circuit breakers of the upstream consumers so they fail fast while the microser‐
vice is offline. Once it’s back, we can close the circuit breakers, and everything should
