Client-side
With client-side caching, the data is cached outside the scope of the origin. In our
example, this could be done as simply as holding an in-memory hashtable with a
mapping between ID and name of album inside the running Sales process, as in
Figure 13-10. This means that generating our top ten takes any interaction with Cata
log out of scope, assuming we get a cache hit for each lookup we need to make. It’s
important to note that our client cache could decide to cache only some of the infor‐
mation we get from the microservice. For example, we might get back lots of infor‐
mation about a CD when we ask for information about it, but if all we care about is
the name of the album, that’s all we have to store in our local cache.
