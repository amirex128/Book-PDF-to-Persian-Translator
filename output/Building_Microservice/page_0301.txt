CHAPTER 9
Testing
The world of automated testing has advanced significantly since I first started writing
code, and every month there seems to be some new tool or technique to make it even
better. But challenges remain regarding how to effectively and efficiently test our
code’s functionality when it spans a distributed system. This chapter breaks down the
problems associated with testing finer-grained systems and presents some solutions
to help you make sure you can release your new functionality with confidence.
Testing covers a lot of ground. Even when we are talking only about automated tests,
there are a large number to consider. With microservices, we have added another
level of complexity. Understanding what different types of tests we can run is impor‐
tant to help us balance the sometimes-opposing forces of getting our software into
production as quickly as possible versus making sure our software is of sufficient
quality. Given the scope of testing as a whole, I am not going to attempt a broad
exploration of the topic. Instead, this chapter is primarily focused on looking at how
testing of a microservice architecture is different when compared to less-distributed
systems such as single-process monolithic applications.
Where testing is done has also shifted since the first edition of this book. Previously,
testing was predominantly carried out before the software got to production. Increas‐
ingly, though, we look at testing our applications once they arrive in production—
further blurring the lines between development and production-related activities; this
is something we’ll explore in this chapter before exploring testing in production more
fully in Chapter 10.
