CHAPTER 10
From Monitoring to Observability
As I’ve shown so far, I hope, breaking our system up into smaller, fine-grained
microservices results in multiple benefits. It also, as we’ve also covered in some
depth, adds significant sources of new complexity. In no situation is this increased
complexity more evident than when it comes to understanding the behavior of our
systems in a production environment. Very early on, you’ll find that the tools and
techniques that worked well for relatively simpler single-process monolithic applica‐
tions don’t work as well for your microservice architecture.
In this chapter, we’ll look at the challenges associated with monitoring our microser‐
vice architecture, and I’ll show that although new tools can help, fundamentally you
may need to shift your entire mindset when it comes to working out what the hell is
going on in production. We’ll also talk about the increased focus on the concept of
observability—understanding how to make it possible to ask questions of our system
so we can work out what is going wrong.
Production Pain
You won’t truly appreciate the potential pain, suffering, and
anguish caused by a microservice architecture until you have it
running in production and serving real traffic.
Disruption, Panic, and Confusion
Picture the scene: it’s a quiet Friday afternoon, and the team is looking forward to
slipping out early to the pub as a way to start a weekend away from work. Then sud‐
denly the emails arrive. The website is misbehaving! Twitter is ablaze with your com‐
pany’s failings, your boss is chewing your ear off, and the prospects of a quiet
weekend vanish.
