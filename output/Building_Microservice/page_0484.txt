Drivers for Dedicated Frontend Teams
The desire for dedicated frontend teams seems to come down to three key factors:
scarcity of specialists, a drive for consistency, and technical challenges.
Firstly, delivering a user interface requires a degree of specialized skills. There are the
interaction and graphical design aspects, and then there is the technical know-how
required to deliver a great web or native application experience. Specialists with these
skills can be hard to come by, and as these folks are such a rare commodity, the temp‚Äê
tation is to stick them all together so you can make sure they are focusing only on
their specialty.
The second driver for a separate frontend team is consistency. If you have one team
responsible for delivering your customer-facing user interface, you can ensure your
UI has a consistent look and feel. You use a consistent set of controls to solve similar
problems so that the user interface looks and feels like a single, cohesive entity.
