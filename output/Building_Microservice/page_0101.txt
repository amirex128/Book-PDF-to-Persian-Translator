Fundamentally, the decision about which functionality to split into a microservice
will end up being a balance between these two forces—how easy the extraction is ver‐
sus the benefit of extracting the microservice in the first place.
My advice for the first couple of microservices would be to pick things that lean a bit
more toward the “easy” end of the spectrum—a microservice that we think has some
impact in terms of achieving our end-to-end goal, certainly, but something we’d con‐
sider to be low-hanging fruit. It is important with a transition like this, especially one
that could take months or years, to gain a sense of momentum early on. So you need
some quick wins under your belt.
On the other hand, if you try to extract what you consider to be the easiest microser‐
vice and aren’t able to make it work, it might be worth reconsidering whether micro‐
services are really right for you and your organization.
