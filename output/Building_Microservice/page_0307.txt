End-to-End Tests
End-to-end tests are tests run against your entire system. Often they will be driving a
GUI through a browser, but they could easily be mimicking other sorts of user inter‐
action, such as uploading a file.
These tests cover a lot of production code, as we see in Figure 9-6. Thus when they
pass, you feel good: you have a high degree of confidence that the code being tested
will work in production. But this increased scope comes with downsides, and as we’ll
see shortly, end-to-end tests can be very tricky to do well in a microservices context.
