Hands On: Deploying etcd
etcd is a distributed lock server developed by CoreOS. It is robust and proven in pro‐
duction at high scale, and is used by a variety of projects including Kubernetes.
Deploying etcd has fortunately become quite easy due to the development of two dif‐
ferent open source projects:
• Helm: a Kubernetes package manager supported by Microsoft Azure
• The etcd operator developed by CoreOS
Operators are an interesting topic being explored by CoreOS. An
operator is an online program that runs inside your container
orchestrator with the express purpose of running one or more
applications. The operator is responsible for creating, scaling, and
maintaining the successful operation of the program. Users config‐
ure the application through a desired state API. For example, the
etcd operator is in charge of monitoring etcd itself. Operators are
still a new idea but represent an important new direction in build‐
ing reliable distributed systems.
To deploy the etcd operator for CoreOS, we’re going to use the helm package manage‐
ment tool. Helm is an open source package manager that is part of the Kubernetes
project, and was developed by Deis. Deis was acquired by Microsoft Azure in 2017
and Microsoft continues to support the further open source development of Helm.
If this is your first time using helm, you need to install the helm tool, following the
instructions here: https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/releases.
Once you have the helm tool installed in your environment, you can install the etcd
operator using helm, as follows:
# Initialize helm
helm init
# Install the etcd operator
helm install stable/etcd-operator
Once the operator is installed, it creates a custom Kubernetes resource to represent
the etcd cluster. The operator is running, but there are no etcd clusters yet. To create
an etcd cluster, you need to create a declarative configuration:
apiVersion: "etcd.coreos.com/v1beta1"
kind: "Cluster"
metadata:
  # Whatever name you want here
  name: "my-etcd-cluster"
