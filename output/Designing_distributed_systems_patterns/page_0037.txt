When adapting an existing application to a sharded backend, you can introduce an
ambassador container that contains all of the logic needed to route requests to the
appropriate storage shard. Thus, your frontend or middleware application only con‐
nects to what appears to be a single storage backend running on localhost. However,
this server is in fact actually a sharding ambassador proxy, which receives all of the
requests from your application code, sends a request to the appropriate storage shard,
and then returns the result to your application. This use of an ambassador is dia‐
grammed in Figure 3-3.
The net result of applying the ambassador pattern to sharded services is a separation
of concerns between the application container, which simply knows it needs to talk to
a storage service and discovers that service on localhost, and the sharding ambassa‐
dor proxy, which only contains the code necessary to perform appropriate sharding.
As with all good single-node patterns, this ambassador can be reused between many
different applications. Or, as we’ll see in the following hands-on example, an off-the
shelf open source implementation can be used for the ambassador, speeding up the
development of the overall distributed system.
Hands On: Implementing a Sharded Redis
Redis is a fast key-value store that can be used as a cache or for more persistent stor‐
age. In this example, we’ll be using it as a cache. We’ll begin by deploying a sharded
Redis service to a Kubernetes cluster. We’ll use the StatefulSet API object to deploy
it, since it will give us unique DNS names for each shard that we can use when con‐
figuring the proxy.
The StatefulSet for Redis looks like this:
apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: sharded-redis
spec:
  serviceName: "redis"
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: redis
    spec:
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 10
      containers:
      - name: redis
        image: redis
        ports:
        - containerPort: 6379
          name: redis
