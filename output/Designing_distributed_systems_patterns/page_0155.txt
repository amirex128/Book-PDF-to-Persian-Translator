This data represents the information found in a single image. To aggregate all of this
data together, we will use the reduce pattern described previously and made famous
by MapReduce to sum everything together just as we did in the count example above.
At the end, this reduce pipeline stage produces the final count of images and colors
found in the complete set of images.
