  <h3>Colophon</h3>

   The animal on the cover of Designing Distributed Systems is a Java sparrow. This bird is loathed in the wild but loved in captivity. The Java’s scientific name is Padda oryzivora. Padda stands for paddy, the method of cultivating rice, and Oryza is the genus for domestic rice. Therefore, Padda oryzivora means “rice paddy eater.” Farmers destroy thousands of wild Javas each year to prevent the flocks from devouring their crops. They also trap the birds for food or sell them in the international bird trade.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite this battle, the species continues to thrive in Java and Bali in Indonesia, as well as Australia, Mexico, and North America.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its plumage is pearly-grey, turning pinkish on the front and white towards the tail. It has a black head with white cheeks. Its large bill, legs, and eye circles are bright pink.
  </p>
  <p>
   The song of the Java sparrow begins with single notes, like a bell, before developing into a continuous trilling and clucking, mixed with high-pitched and deeper notes.
  </p>
  <p>
   The main part of their diet is rice, but they also eat small seeds, grasses, insects, and flowering plants. In the wild, these birds will build a nest out of dried grass normally under the roofs of buildings or in bushes or treetops. The Java will lay a clutch of three or four eggs between February to August, with most eggs laid in April or May.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its striking plumage, enchanting sounds, and ease of care create a demand for these birds in the cage-bird trade. Conservation efforts are underway to ensure that the market demand is met by captive-bred birds rather than wild caught.
