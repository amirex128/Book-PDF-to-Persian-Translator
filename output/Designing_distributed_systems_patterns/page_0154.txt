Finally we need to design the queue that identifies vehicles and colors and aggregates
these statistics into a final count. To do this, we first again apply the shard pattern to
distribute the work out to a number of queues. Each of these queues has two different
workers: one that identifies the location and type of each vehicle and one that identi‐
fies the color of a region. We will again join these together using the multi-worker
pattern described in the previous chapter. As before, the separation of code into dif‐
ferent containers enables us to reuse the color detection container for multiple tasks
beyond identifying the color of the cars.
The output of this work queue is a JSON tuple that looks like this:
{
  "vehicles": {
     "car": 12,
     "truck": 7,
     "motorcycle": 4
   },
   "colors": {
     "white": 8,
     "black": 3,
     "blue": 6,
     "red": 6
