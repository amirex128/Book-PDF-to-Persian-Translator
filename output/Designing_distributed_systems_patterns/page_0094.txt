Figure 7-4. A sharded, replicated scatter/gatther system
Built this way, each leaf request from the root is actually load balanced across all
healthy replicas of the shard. This means that if there are any failures, they wonâ€™t
result in a user-visible outage for your system. Likewise, you can safely perform an
upgrade under load, since each replicated shard can be upgraded one replica at a
time. Indeed, you can perform the upgrade across multiple shards simultaneously,
depending on how quickly you want to perform the upgrade.
