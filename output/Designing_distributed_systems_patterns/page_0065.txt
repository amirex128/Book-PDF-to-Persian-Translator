Figure 5-6. Adding the caching layer to our replicated service
Unless you are careful, caching can break session tracking. The rea‐
son for this is that if you use default IP address affinity and load
balancing, all requests will be sent from the IP addresses of the
cache, not the end user of your service. If you’ve followed the
advice previously given and deployed a few large caches, your IP-
address-based affinity may in fact mean that some replicas of your
web layer see no traffic. Instead, you need to use something like a
cookie or HTTP header for session tracking.
Hands On: Deploying the Caching Layer
The dictionary-server service we built earlier distributes traffic to the dictionary
server and is discoverable as the DNS name dictionary-server-service. This pat‐
tern is illustrated in Figure 5-7.
