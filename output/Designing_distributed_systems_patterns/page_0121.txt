PART III
Batch Computational Patterns
The preceding chapter described patterns for reliable, long-running server applica‚Äê
tions. This section describes patterns for batch processing. In contrast to long-
running applications, batch processes are expected to only run for a short period of
time. Examples of a batch process include generating aggregation of user telemetry
data, analyzing sales data for daily or weekly reporting, or transcoding video files.
Batch processes are generally characterized by the need to process large amounts of
data quickly using parallelism to speed up the processing. The most famous pattern
for distributed batch processing is the MapReduce pattern, which has become an
entire industry in itself. However, there are several other patterns that are useful for
batch processing, which are described in the following chapters.
