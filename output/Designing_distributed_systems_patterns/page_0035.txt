CHAPTER 3
Ambassadors
The previous chapter introduced the sidecar pattern, where one container augments a
pre-existing container to add functionality. This chapter introduces the ambassador
pattern, where an ambassador container brokers interactions between the application
container and the rest of the world. As with other single-node patterns, the two con‐
tainers are tightly linked in a symbiotic pairing that is scheduled to a single machine.
A canonical diagram of this pattern is shown in Figure 3-1.
Figure 3-1. Generic ambassador pattern
The value of the ambassador pattern is twofold. First, as with the other single-node
patterns, there is inherent value in building modular, reusable containers. The separa‐
tion of concerns makes the containers easier to build and maintain. Likewise, the
ambassador container can be reused with a number of different application contain‐
ers. This reuse speeds up application development because the container’s code can be
reused in a number of places. Additionally the implementation is both more consis‐
tent and of a higher quality because it is built once and used in many different con‐
texts.
The rest of this chapter provides a number of examples of using the ambassador pat‐
tern to implement a series of real-world applications.
