CHAPTER 12
Coordinated Batch Processing
The previous chapter described a number of patterns for splitting and chaining
queues together to achieve more complex batch processing. Duplicating and produc‚Äê
ing multiple different outputs is often an important part of batch processing, but
sometimes it is equally important to pull multiple outputs back together in order to
generate some sort of aggregate output. A generic illustration of such a pattern is
shown in Figure 12-1.
