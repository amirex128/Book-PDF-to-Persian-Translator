Depending on your goals and the systems you are interested in developing, you can
choose to focus on either large-scale big data patterns, or patterns for long-running
servers (or both). The two parts are largely independent from each other and can be
read in any order.
Likewise, if you have extensive distributed system experience, you may find that some
of the early patterns chapters (e.g., Part II on naming, discovery, and load balancing)
are redundant with what you already know, so feel free to skim through to gain the
high-level insights—but don’t forget to look at all of the pretty pictures!
