and extends an application container to add functionality. Sidecars can be used to
update existing legacy applications when changing the application is too costly. Like‐
wise, they can be used to create modular utility containers that standardize imple‐
mentations of common functionality. These utility containers can be reused in a large
number of applications, increasing consistency and reducing the cost of developing
each application. Subsequent chapters introduce other single-node patterns that
demonstrate other uses for modular, reusable containers.
