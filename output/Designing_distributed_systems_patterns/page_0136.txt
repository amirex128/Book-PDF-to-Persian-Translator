Figure 11-1. This workflow combines copying work into multiple queues (Stage 2a, 2b)
parallel processing of those queues, and combining the result back into a single queue
(Stage 3)
Patterns of Event-Driven Processing
Beyond the simple work queue described in the previous chapter, there are a number
of patterns for linking work queues together. The simplest pattern—one where the
output of a single queue becomes the input to a second queue—is straightforward
enough that we won’t cover it here. We will describe patterns that involve the coordi‐
nation of multiple different queues or the modification of the output of one or more
work queues.
Copier
The first pattern for coordinating work queues is a copier. The job of a copier is to
take a single stream of work items and duplicate it out into two or more identical
streams. This pattern is useful when there are multiple different pieces of work to be
done on the same work item. An example of this might be rendering a video. When
rendering a video, there are a variety of different formats that are useful depending on
