CHAPTER 10
Work Queue Systems
The simplest form of batch processing is a work queue. In a work queue system, there
is a batch of work to be performed. Each piece of work is wholly independent of the
other and can be processed without any interactions. Generally, the goals of the work
queue system are to ensure that each piece of work is processed within a certain
amount of time. Workers are scaled up or scaled down to ensure that the work can be
handled. An illustration of a generic work queue is shown in Figure 10-1.

A Generic Work Queue System
The work queue is an ideal way to demonstrate the power of distributed system pat‐
terns. Most of the logic in the work queue is wholly independent of the actual work
being done, and in many cases the delivery of the work can be performed in an inde‐
pendent manner as well. To illustrate this point, consider the work queue illustrated
in Figure 10-1. If we take a look at it again and identify functionality that can be pro‐
vided by a shared set of library containers, it becomes apparent that most of the
implementation of a containerized work queue can be shared across a wide variety of
users, as shown in Figure 10-2.
