Figure 12-2. The join pattern for batch processing
Reduce
If sharding a work queue is an example of the map phase of the canonical map/reduce
algorithm, then what remains is the reduce phase. Reduce is an example of a coordi‐
nated batch processing pattern because it can happen regardless of how the input is
split up, and it is used similar to join; that is, to group together the parallel output of a
number of different batch operations on different pieces of data.
However, in contrast to the join pattern described previously, the goal of reduce is not
to wait until all data has been processed, but rather to optimistically merge together
all of the parallel data items into a single comprehensive representation of the full set.
With the reduce pattern, each step in the reduce merges several different outputs into
a single output. This stage is called “reduce” because it reduces the total number of
outputs. Additionally, it reduces the data from a complete data item to simply the
representative data necessary for producing the answer to a specific batch computa‐
tion. Because the reduce phase operates on a range of input, and produces a similar
output, the reduce phase can be repeated as many or as few times as necessary in
order to successfully reduce the output down to a single output for the entire data set.
