To create the replicated nginx servers, you use:
kubectl create -f nginx-deploy.yaml
Finally, you can expose this nginx SSL server with a service:
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx-ssl
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 443
      targetPort: 443
To create this load-balancing service run:
kubectl create -f nginx-service.yaml
If you create this service on a Kubernetes cluster that supports external load balanc‚Äê
ers, this will create an externalized, public service that services traffic on a public IP
address.
To get this IP address, you can run:
kubectl get services
You should then be able to access the service with your web browser.
Summary
This chapter began with a simple pattern for replicated stateless services. Then we
saw how this pattern grows with two additional replicated load-balanced layers to
provide caching for performance, and SSL termination for secure web serving. This
complete pattern for stateless replicated serving is shown in Figure 5-8.
This complete pattern can be deployed into Kubernetes using three Deployments and
Service load balancers to connect the layers shown in Figure 5-8. The complete
source for these examples can be found at https://github.com/brendandburns/
designing-distributed-systems.
