CHAPTER 5
Replicated Load-Balanced Services
The simplest distributed pattern, and one that most are familiar with, is a replicated
load-balanced service. In such a service, every server is identical to every other server
and all are capable of supporting traffic. The pattern consists of a scalable number of
servers with a load balancer in front of them. The load balancer is typically either
completely round-robin or uses some form of session stickiness. The chapter will give
a concrete example of how to deploy such a service in Kubernetes.
Stateless Services
Stateless services are ones that don’t require saved state to operate correctly. In the
simplest stateless applications, even individual requests may be routed to separate
instances of the service (see Figure 5-1). Examples of stateless services include things
like static content servers and complex middleware systems that receive and aggre‐
gate responses from numerous different backend systems.
