Hands On: Deploying nginx and SSL Termination
The following instructions describe how to add a replicated SSL terminating nginx to
the replicated service and cache that we previously deployed.
These instructions assume that you have a certificate. If you need
to obtain a certificate, the easiest way to do that is via the tools at
Let’s Encrypt. Alternately, you can use the openssl tool to create
them. The following instructions assume that you’ve named them
server.crt (public certificate) and server.key (private key on the
server). Such self-signed certificates will cause security alerts in
modern web browsers and should never be used for production.
The first step is to upload your certificate as a secret to Kubernetes:
kubectl create secret tls ssl --cert=server.crt --key=server.key
Once you have uploaded your certificate as a secret you need to create an nginx con‐
figuration to serve SSL:
events {
  worker_connections  1024;
}
http {
  server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name my-domain.com www.my-domain.com;
