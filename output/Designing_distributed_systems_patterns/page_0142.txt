Hands On: Building an Event-Driven Flow for New User
Sign-Up
A concrete example of a workflow helps show how these patterns can be put together
to form a complete operating system. The problem this example will consider is a
new-user signup flow.
Imagine that our user acquisition funnel has two stages. The first is user verification.
After a new user signs up, the user then has to receive an email notification to validate
their email. Once the user validates their email, they are sent a confirmation email.
Then they are optionally registered for email, text message, both, or neither for notifi‐
cations.
The first step in the event-driven workflow is the generation of the verification email.
To achieve this reliably, we will use the shard pattern to shard users across multiple
different geographic failure zones. This ensures that we will continue to process new
user signups, even in the presence of partial failures. Each work queue shard sends a
verification email to the end user. At this point, this substage of the workflow is com‐
plete. This first stage of the flow is illustrated in Figure 11-8.

The workflow begins again when we receive a verification email from the end user.
These emails become new events in a separate (but clearly related) workflow that
sends welcome emails and sets up notifications. The first stage of this workflow is an
example of the copier pattern, where the user is copied into two work queues. The
first work queue is responsible for sending the welcome email, and the second work
queue is responsible for setting up user notifications.
Once the work items have been duplicated between the queues, the email-sending
queue simply takes care of sending an email message, and the workflow exits. But
remember that because of the use of the copier pattern, there is still an additional
