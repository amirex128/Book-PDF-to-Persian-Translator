9.1  Security General Scenario
149
■
■Environment. The attack can come when the system is either online or 
offline, either connected to or disconnected from a network, either behind a 
firewall or open to a network, fully operational, partially operational, or not 
operational.
■
■Response. The system should ensure that transactions are carried out in a 
fashion such that data or services are protected from unauthorized access; 
data or services are not being manipulated without authorization; parties 
to a transaction are identified with assurance; the parties to the transaction 
cannot repudiate their involvements; and the data, resources, and system 
services will be available for legitimate use. 
The system should also track activities within it by recording access 
or modification; attempts to access data, resources, or services; and noti-
fying appropriate entities (people or systems) when an apparent attack is 
occurring.
■
■Response measure. Measures of a system’s response include how much 
of a system is compromised when a particular component or data value is 
compromised, how much time passed before an attack was detected, how 
many attacks were resisted, how long it took to recover from a successful 
attack, and how much data was vulnerable to a particular attack.
Table 9.1 enumerates the elements of the general scenario, which charac-
terize security, and Figure 9.1 shows a sample concrete scenario: A disgruntled 
employee from a remote location attempts to modify the pay rate table during 
normal operations. The system maintains an audit trail, and the correct data is 
restored within a day.
