13—Architectural Tactics and Patterns
We can now represent the tactics-based set of architectural design decisions 
made thus far as in Figure 13.20.
A tactic to address the concern that all communication passes through the 
intermediary is restrict dependencies. One consideration associated with the 
restrict dependencies tactic is this:
■
■Performance. How to ensure that the performance overhead of the 
intermediary is not excessive?
This design problem has now become recursive! At this point (or in fact, 
at any point in the tree of design decisions that we have described) the architect 
might determine that the performance overhead of the intermediary is small 
enough that no further design decisions need to be made.
