Figure 14.2  An allocation view, in UML, of a model-view-controller architecture
Given that quality attribute models such as the performance model shown 
in Figure 14.1 already exist, the problem becomes how to map these allocation 
and coordination decisions onto Figure 14.1. Doing this yields Figure 14.3. 
There are requests coming from users outside the system—labeled as 1 in Fig-
ure 14.3—arriving at the view. The view processes the requests and sends some
