document that does a good job of capturing all of a system’s quality requirements 
in testable detail (a property is testable if it is falsifiable; “make the system easy 
to use” is not falsifiable but “deliver audio packets with no more than 10 ms. 
jitter” is falsifiable). The architect often has to fill in the blanks—the quality attri-
bute requirements that have not been explicitly stated—and mediate the conflicts 
that frequently emerge.
Therefore, one of the best pieces of advice we can give to architects is this: 
Know your stakeholders. Talk to them, engage them, listen to them, and put your-
self in their shoes. Table 3.1 enumerates a set of stakeholders. Notice the remark-
able variety and length of this set, but remember that not every stakeholder named 
in this list may play a role in every system, and one person may play many roles.
