8.2  Tactics for Performance
The goal of performance tactics is to generate a response to an event arriving 
at the system within some time-based constraint. The event can be single or a 
stream and is the trigger to perform computation. Performance tactics control the 
time within which a response is generated, as illustrated in Figure 8.2. 
At any instant during the period after an event arrives but before the sys-
tem’s response t`o it is complete, either the system is working to respond to that 
event or the processing is blocked for some reason. This leads to the two basic 
contributors to the response time: processing time (when the system is working to 
respond) and blocked time (when the system is unable to respond).
