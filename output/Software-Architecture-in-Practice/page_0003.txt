T
he SEI Series in Software Engineering represents is a collaborative 
undertaking of the Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute (SEI) and 
Addison-Wesley to develop and publish books on software engineering and 
related topics. The common goal of the SEI and Addison-Wesley is to provide 
the most current information on these topics in a form that is easily usable by 
practitioners and students.
Books in the series describe frameworks, tools, methods, and technologies 
designed to help organizations, teams, and individuals improve their technical 
or management capabilities. Some books describe processes and practices for 
developing higher-quality software, acquiring programs for complex systems, or 
delivering services more effectively. Other books focus on software and system 
architecture and product-line development. Still others, from the SEIâ€™s CERT 
Program, describe technologies and practices needed to manage software 
and network security risk. These and all books in the series address critical 
problems in software engineering for which practical solutions are available.
