The Swedish Ship Vasa
In the 1620s, Sweden and Poland were at war. The king of Sweden, 
Gustavus Adolphus, was determined to put a swift and favorable end to it 
and commissioned a new warship the likes of which had never been seen 
before. The Vasa, shown in Figure 3.1, was to be the world’s most formi-
dable instrument of war: 70 meters long, able to carry 300 soldiers, and 
with an astonishing 64 heavy guns mounted on two gun decks. Seeking to 
add overwhelming firepower to his navy to strike a decisive blow, the king 
insisted on stretching the Vasa’s armaments to the limits. Her architect, 
Henrik Hybertsson, was a seasoned Dutch shipbuilder with an impeccable 
reputation, but the Vasa was beyond even his broad experience. Two-
gun-deck ships were rare, and none had been built of the Vasa’s size and 
armament. 
Like all architects of systems that push the envelope of experience, 
Hybertsson had to balance many concerns. Swift time to deployment was 
critical, but so were performance, functionality, safety, reliability, and cost.
