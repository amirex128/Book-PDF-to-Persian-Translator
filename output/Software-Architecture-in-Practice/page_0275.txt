transformation of the requests on to the controller—labeled as 2. Some actions of 
the controller are returned to the view—labeled as 3. The controller sends other 
actions on to the model—labeled 4. The model performs its activities and sends 
information back to the view—labeled 5.
To analyze the model in Figure 14.3, a number of items need to be known 
or estimated: 
■
■The frequency of arrivals from outside the system
■
■The queuing discipline used at the view queue
■
■The time to process a message within the view
■
■The number and size of messages that the view sends to the controller
■
■The bandwidth of the network that connects the view and the controller
■
■The queuing discipline used by the controller
■
■The time to process a message within the controller
■
■The number and size of messages that the controller sends back to the view
■
■The bandwidth of the network used for messages from the controller to the 
view
■
■The number and size of messages that the controller sends to the model
■
■The queuing discipline used by the model
■
■The time to process a message within the model
■
■The number and size of messages the model sends to the view
■
■The bandwidth of the network connecting the model and the view
