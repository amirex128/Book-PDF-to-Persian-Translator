Part Two  Quality Attributes	
12—Other Quality Attributes
Once you have a model for your QA, then you can work to catalog the ar-
chitectural approaches (tactics and patterns) open to you for manipulating each of 
the relevant parameters in your favor.
Assemble a Set of Tactics for the New Quality Attribute
There are two sources that can be used to derive tactics for any quality attribute: 
models and experts. 
Figure 12.2 shows a queuing model for performance. Such models are 
widely used to analyze the latency and throughput of various types of queuing 
systems, including manufacturing and service environments, as well as computer 
systems. 
Within this model, there are seven parameters that can affect the latency that 
the model predicts: 
■
■Arrival rate
■
■Queuing discipline
■
■Scheduling algorithm
■
■Service time
■
■Topology 
■
■Network bandwidth
■
■Routing algorithm
