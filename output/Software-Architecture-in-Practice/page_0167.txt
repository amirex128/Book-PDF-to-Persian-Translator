8—Performance
3.	
Write several performance scenarios for an automatic teller machine. Think 
about whether your major concern is worst-case latency, average-case la-
tency, throughput, or some other response measure. How would you modify 
your automatic teller machine design to accommodate these scenarios?
4.	
Web-based systems often use proxy servers, which are the first element of 
the system to receive a request from a client (such as your browser). Proxy 
servers are able to serve up often-requested web pages, such as a company’s 
home page, without bothering the real application servers that carry out 
transactions. There may be many proxy servers, and they are often located 
geographically close to large user communities, to decrease response time 
for routine requests. What performance tactics do you see at work here?
5.	
 A fundamental difference between coordination mechanisms is whether 
interaction is synchronous or asynchronous. Discuss the advantages and 
disadvantages of each with respect to each of the performance responses: 
latency, deadline, throughput, jitter, miss rate, data loss, or any other re-
quired performance-related response you may be used to.
6.	
Find real-world (that is, nonsoftware) examples of applying each of the 
manage-resources tactics. For example, suppose you were managing a 
brick-and-mortar big-box retail store. How would you get people through 
the checkout lines faster using these tactics?
7.	
User interface frameworks typically are single-threaded. Why is this so and 
what are the performance implications of this single-threading?
