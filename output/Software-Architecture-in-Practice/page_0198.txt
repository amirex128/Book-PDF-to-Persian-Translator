11.2  Tactics for Usability
Recall that usability is concerned with how easy it is for the user to accomplish 
a desired task, as well as the kind of support the system provides to the user. 
Researchers in human-computer interaction have used the terms user initiative, 
system initiative, and mixed initiative to describe which of the human-computer 
pair takes the initiative in performing certain actions and how the interaction pro-
ceeds. Usability scenarios can combine initiatives from both perspectives. For 
example, when canceling a command, the user issues a cancel—user initiative—
and the system responds. During the cancel, however, the system may put up a 
progress indicator—system initiative. Thus, cancel may demonstrate mixed ini-
tiative. We use this distinction between user and system initiative to discuss the 
tactics that the architect uses to achieve the various scenarios.
Figure 11.2 shows the goal of the set of runtime usability tactics.
