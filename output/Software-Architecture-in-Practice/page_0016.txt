Preface
I should have no objection to go over the same 
life from its beginning to the end: requesting only 
the advantage authors have, of correcting in a 
[third] edition the faults of the first [two].
— Benjamin Franklin
It has been a decade since the publication of the second edition of this book. 
During that time, the field of software architecture has broadened its focus 
from being primarily internally oriented—How does one design, evaluate, 
and document software?—to including external impacts as well—a deeper 
understanding of the influences on architectures and a deeper understanding of 
the impact architectures have on the life cycle, organizations, and management.
The past ten years have also seen dramatic changes in the types of systems 
being constructed. Large data, social media, and the cloud are all areas that, at 
most, were embryonic ten years ago and now are not only mature but extremely 
influential.
We listened to some of the criticisms of the previous editions and have 
included much more material on patterns, reorganized the material on quality 
attributes, and made interoperability a quality attribute worthy of its own chapter. 
We also provide guidance about how you can generate scenarios and tactics for 
your own favorite quality attributes.
To accommodate this plethora of new material, we had to make difficult 
choices. In particular, this edition of the book does not include extended 
case studies as the prior editions did. This decision also reflects the maturing 
of the field, in the sense that case studies about the choices made in software 
architectures are more prevalent than they were ten years ago, and they are less 
necessary to convince readers of the importance of software architecture. The 
case studies from the first two editions are available, however, on the book’s 
website, at www.informit.com/title/9780321815736. In addition, on the same 
website, we have slides that will assist instructors in presenting this material.
We have thoroughly reworked many of the topics covered in this edition. 
In particular, we realize that the methods we present—for architecture design, 
analysis, and documentation—are one version of how to achieve a particular 
goal, but there are others. This led us to separate the methods that we present
