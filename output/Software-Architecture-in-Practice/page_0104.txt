Figure 5.1, taken from a NASA handbook on fault tree analysis, shows 
a very simple fault tree for which the top event is failure of component D. It 
shows that component D can fail if A fails and either B or C fails.
The symbols that connect the events in a fault tree are called gate symbols, 
and are taken from Boolean logic diagrams. Figure 5.2 illustrates the notation.
A fault tree lends itself to static analysis in various ways. For example, a 
“minimal cut set” is the smallest combination of events along the bottom of 
the tree that together can cause the top event. The set of minimal cut sets 
shows all the ways the bottom events can combine to cause the overarch-
ing failure. Any singleton minimal cut set reveals a single point of failure, 
which should be carefully scrutinized. Also, the probabilities of various con-
tributing failures can be combined to come up with a probability of the top 
event occurring. Dynamic analysis occurs when the order of contributing 
failures matters. In this case, techniques such as Markov analysis can be 
used to calculate probability of failure over different failure sequences. 
Fault trees aid in system design, but they can also be used to diagnose 
failures at runtime. If the top event has occurred, then (assuming the fault 
tree model is complete) one or more of the contributing failures has oc-
curred, and the fault tree can be used to track it down and initiate repairs.
Failure Mode, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) catalogs the 
kinds of failures that systems of a given type are prone to, along with how 
severe the effects of each one can be. FMECA relies on the history of
