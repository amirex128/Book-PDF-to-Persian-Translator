The Analytic Model Space
As we discussed in the preceding sections, there are a growing number of analytic 
models for some aspects of various quality attributes. One of the quests of software 
engineering is to have a sufficient number of analytic models for a sufficiently large 
number of quality attributes to enable prediction of the behavior of a designed sys-
tem based on these analytic models. Table 14.2 shows our current status with respect 
to this quest for the seven quality attributes discussed in Chapters 5–11.

Quality 
Attribute
Intellectual Basis
Maturity/Gaps
Availability
Markov models; 
statistical models
Moderate maturity; mature in the 
hardware reliability domain, less mature 
in the software domain. Requires models 
that speak to state recovery and for which 
failure percentages can be attributed to 
software.
Interoperability
Conceptual framework
Low maturity; models require substantial 
human interpretation and input.
Modifiability
Coupling and cohesion 
metrics; cost models
Substantial research in academia; still 
requires more empirical support in real-
world environments.
Performance
Queuing theory; real-
time scheduling theory
High maturity; requires considerable 
education and training to use properly.
Security
No architectural models
 
Testability
Component interaction 
metrics
Low maturity; little empirical validation.
Usability
No architectural models
