Why Standards Are Not Enough to Guarantee Interoperability 
By Grace Lewis
Developer of System A needs to exchange product data with System B. 
Developer A finds that there is an existing WS* web service interface for 
sending product data that among other fields contains price expressed 
in XML Schema as a decimal with two fraction digits. Developer A writes 
code to interact with the web service and the system works perfectly. 
However, after two weeks of operation, there is a huge discrepancy be-
tween the totals reported by System A and the totals reported by System 
B. After conversations between the two developers, they discover that 
System B expected to receive a price that included tax and System A was 
sending it without tax. 
This is a simple example of why standards are not enough. The sys-
tems exchanged data perfectly because they both agreed that the price 
was a decimal with two fractions digits expressed in XML Schema and the 
message was sent via SOAP over HTTP (syntax)—standards used in the 
implementation of WS* web services—but they did not agree on whether 
the price included tax or not (semantics).
Of course, the only realistic approach to getting diverse applications to 
share information is by reaching agreements on the structure and func-
tion of the information to be shared. These agreements are often reflected 
in standards that provide a common interface that multiple vendors and 
application builders support. Standards have indeed been instrumental
