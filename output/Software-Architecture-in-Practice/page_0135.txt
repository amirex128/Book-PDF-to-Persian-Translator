Checklist
Allocation of 
Responsibilities
Determine which of your system responsibilities will need to 
interoperate with other systems.
Ensure that responsibilities have been allocated to detect 
a request to interoperate with known or unknown external 
systems. 
Ensure that responsibilities have been allocated to carry out the 
following tasks: 
■
■
Accept the request
■
■
Exchange information
■
■
Reject the request
■
■
Notify appropriate entities (people or systems)
■
■
Log the request (for interoperability in an untrusted environ-
ment, logging for nonrepudiation is essential) 
Coordination Model
Ensure that the coordination mechanisms can meet the critical 
quality attribute requirements. Considerations for performance 
include the following:
■
■
Volume of traffic on the network both created by the sys-
tems under your control and generated by systems not 
under your control
■
■
Timeliness of the messages being sent by your systems
■
■
Currency of the messages being sent by your systems
■
■
Jitter of the messages’ arrival times
■
■
Ensure that all of the systems under your control make as-
sumptions about protocols and underlying networks that are 
consistent with the systems not under your control.
Data Model
Determine the syntax and semantics of the major data 
abstractions that may be exchanged among interoperating 
systems.
Ensure that these major data abstractions are consistent with 
data from the interoperating systems. (If your system’s data 
model is confidential and must not be made public, you may 
have to apply transformations to and from the data abstractions 
of systems with which yours interoperates.)
Mapping among 
Architectural 
Elements
For interoperability, the critical mapping is that of components 
to processors. Beyond the necessity of making sure that 
components that communicate externally are hosted 
on processors that can reach the network, the primary 
considerations deal with meeting the security, availability, and 
performance requirements for the communication. These will 
be dealt with in their respective chapters.
