Security
With Jungwoo Ryoo and Phil Laplante 
Your personal identity isn’t worth quite as much as 
it used to be—at least to thieves willing to swipe it. 
According to experts who monitor such markets, the 
value of stolen credit card data may range from $3 to 
as little as 40 cents. That’s down tenfold from a decade 
ago—even though the cost to an individual who has a 
credit card stolen can soar into the hundreds of dollars.

Security is a measure of the system’s ability to protect data and information from 
unauthorized access while still providing access to people and systems that are 
authorized. An action taken against a computer system with the intention of do-
ing harm is called an attack and can take a number of forms. It may be an un-
authorized attempt to access data or services or to modify data, or it may be in-
tended to deny services to legitimate users.
The simplest approach to characterizing security has three characteristics: 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA):
1.	
Confidentiality is the property that data or services are protected from 
unauthorized access. For example, a hacker cannot access your income tax 
returns on a government computer.
2.	
Integrity is the property that data or services are not subject to unauthorized 
manipulation. For example, your grade has not been changed since your 
instructor assigned it.
3.	
Availability is the property that the system will be available for legitimate 
use. For example, a denial-of-service attack won’t prevent you from order-
ing  book from an online bookstore.
