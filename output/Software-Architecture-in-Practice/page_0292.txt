Part  T H R EE
Architecture in 
the Life Cycle
Part I of this book introduced architecture and the various contextual lenses 
through which it could be viewed. To recap from Chapter 3, those contexts in-
clude the following:
■
■Technical. What technical role does the software architecture play in the sys-
tem or systems of which it’s a part? Part of the answer to this is what Part II 
of our book is about and the rest is included in Part IV. Part II describes how 
decisions are made, and Part IV describes the environment that determines 
whether the results of the decisions satisfy the needs of the organization.
■
■Project life cycle. How does a software architecture relate to the other 
phases of a software development life cycle? The answer to this is what 
Part III of our book is about.
■
■Business. How does the presence of a software architecture affect an orga-
nization’s business environment? The answer to this is what Part IV of our 
book is about.
■
■Professional. What is the role of a software architect in an organization or 
a development project? The answer to this is threaded throughout the entire 
book, but especially in Chapter 24, where we treat the duties, skills, and 
knowledge of software architects.
Part II concentrated on the technical context of software architecture. In our 
philosophy, this is tantamount to understanding quality attributes. If you have a 
deep understanding of how architecture affects quality attributes, then you have 
mastered most of what you need to know about making design decisions.
