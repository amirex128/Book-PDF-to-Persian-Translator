13—Architectural Tactics and Patterns
Suppose the architect determines that the performance tradeoff (the overhead 
of adding ping/echo to the system) is the most severe. A tactic to address the 
performance side effect is increase available resources. Considerations associated 
with increase available resources are these:
■
■Cost. Increased resources cost more.
■
■Performance. How to utilize the increased resources efficiently?
This set of design decisions can now be represented as shown in Figure 13.18.
Now the architect chooses to deal with the resource utilization consequence 
of employing increase available resources. These resources must be used efficiently 
or else they are simply adding cost and complexity to the system. A tactic that can 
address the efficient use of resources is the employment of a scheduling policy. Con-
siderations associated with the scheduling policy tactic are these:
■
■Modifiability. How to add the scheduling policy to the existing architecture?
■
■Modifiability. How to change the scheduling policy in the future?
