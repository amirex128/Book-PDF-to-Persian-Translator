6.2  Tactics for Interoperability
111
We identify two categories of interoperability tactics: locate and manage 
interfaces. 
Locate
There is only one tactic in this category: discover service. It is used when the 
systems that interoperate must be discovered at runtime.
■
■Discover service. Locate a service through searching a known directory ser-
vice. (By “service,” we simply mean a set of capabilities that is accessible 
via some kind of interface.) There may be multiple levels of indirection in 
this location process—that is, a known location points to another location 
that in turn can be searched for the service. The service can be located by 
type of service, by name, by location, or by some other attribute.
Manage Interfaces
Managing interfaces consists of two tactics: orchestrate and tailor interface. 
■
■Orchestrate. Orchestrate is a tactic that uses a control mechanism to 
coordinate and manage and sequence the invocation of particular services 
(which could be ignorant of each other). Orchestration is used when the 
interoperating systems must interact in a complex fashion to accomplish a 
complex task; orchestration “scripts” the interaction. Workflow engines are 
an example of the use of the orchestrate tactic. The mediator design pattern 
can serve this function for simple orchestration. Complex orchestration can 
be specified in a language such as BPEL.
■
■Tailor interface. Tailor interface is a tactic that adds or removes capabilities 
to an interface. Capabilities such as translation, adding buffering, or 
smoothing data can be added. Capabilities may be removed as well. An 
example of removing capabilities is to hide particular functions from 
untrusted users. The decorator pattern is an example of the tailor interface 
tactic. 
The enterprise service bus that underlies many service-oriented architec-
tures combines both of the manage interface tactics.
Figure 6.3 shows a summary of the tactics to achieve interoperability.
