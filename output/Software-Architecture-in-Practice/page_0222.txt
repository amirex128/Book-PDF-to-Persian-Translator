12.7  Discussion Questions
1.	
The Kingdom of Bhutan measures the happiness of its population, and 
government policy is formulated to increase Bhutan’s GNH (gross national 
happiness). Go read about how the GNH is measured (try www.grossna-
tionalhappiness.com) and then sketch a general scenario for the quality 
attribute of happiness that will let you express concrete happiness require-
ments for a software system.
2.	
Choose a quality attribute not described in Chapters 5–11. For that quality 
attribute, assemble a set of specific scenarios that describe what you mean 
by it. Use that set of scenarios to construct a general scenario for it.
3.	
For the QA you chose for discussion question 2, assemble a set of design 
approaches (patterns and tactics) that help you achieve it.
4.	
For the QA you chose for discussion question 2, develop a design checklist 
for that quality attribute using the seven categories of guiding quality de-
sign decisions outlined in Chapter 4.
5.	
What might cause you to add a tactic or pattern to the sets of quality attri-
butes already described in Chapters 5–11 (or any other quality attribute, for 
that matter)?

According to slate.com and other sources, a teenage girl in Germany “went 
into hiding after she forgot to set her Facebook birthday invitation to private 
and accidentally invited the entire Internet. After 15,000 people confirmed 
they were coming, the girl’s parents canceled the party, notified police, and 
hired private security to guard their home.” Fifteen hundred people showed 
up anyway; several minor injuries ensued. Is Facebook “unsafe”? Discuss.

Author James Gleick (“A Bug and a Crash,” www.around.com/ariane.html) 
writes that “It took the European Space Agency 10 years and $7 billion to 
produce Ariane 5, a giant rocket capable of hurling a pair of three-ton sat-
ellites into orbit with each launch. . . . All it took to explode that rocket less 
than a minute into its maiden voyage . . . was a small computer program 
trying to stuff a 64-bit number into a 16-bit space. One bug, one crash. Of 
all the careless lines of code recorded in the annals of computer science, 
this one may stand as the most devastatingly efficient.” Write a safety sce-
nario that addresses the Ariane 5 disaster and discuss tactics that might have 
prevented it.

Discuss how you think development distributability tends to “trade off” 
against the quality attributes of performance, availability, modifiability, and 
interoperability.
