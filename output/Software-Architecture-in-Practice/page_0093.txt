Part Two  Quality Attributes	
4—Understanding Quality Attributes
2.	
If no pattern exists to realize the architect’s design goal, tactics allow the 
architect to construct a design fragment from “first principles.” Tactics give 
the architect insight into the properties of the resulting design fragment. 
3.	
By cataloging tactics, we provide a way of making design more systematic 
within some limitations. Our list of tactics does not provide a taxonomy. We 
only provide a categorization. The tactics will overlap, and you frequently 
will have a choice among multiple tactics to improve a particular quality at-
tribute. The choice of which tactic to use depends on factors such as tradeoffs 
among other quality attributes and the cost to implement. These consider-
ations transcend the discussion of tactics for particular quality attributes. 
Chapter 17 provides some techniques for choosing among competing tactics.
The tactics that we present can and should be refined. Consider perfor-
mance: Schedule resources is a common performance tactic. But this tactic needs 
to be refined into a specific scheduling strategy, such as shortest-job-first, round-
robin, and so forth, for specific purposes. Use an intermediary is a modifiability 
tactic. But there are multiple types of intermediaries (layers, brokers, and prox-
ies, to name just a few). Thus there are refinements that a designer will employ to 
make each tactic concrete. 
In addition, the application of a tactic depends on the context. Again consid-
ering performance: Manage sampling rate is relevant in some real-time systems 
but not in all real-time systems and certainly not in database systems.
4.6  Guiding Quality Design Decisions
Recall that one can view an architecture as the result of applying a collection of 
design decisions. What we present here is a systematic categorization of these
