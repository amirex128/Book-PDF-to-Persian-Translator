Availability
With James Scott
Ninety percent of life is just showing up.
—Woody Allen
Availability refers to a property of software that it is there and ready to carry 
out its task when you need it to be. This is a broad perspective and encompasses 
what is normally called reliability (although it may encompass additional con-
siderations such as downtime due to periodic maintenance). In fact, availability 
builds upon the concept of reliability by adding the notion of recovery—that is, 
when the system breaks, it repairs itself. Repair may be accomplished by various 
means, which we’ll see in this chapter. More precisely, Avižienis and his col-
leagues have defined dependability:
Dependability is the ability to avoid failures that are more frequent and 
more severe than is acceptable.
Our definition of availability as an aspect of dependability is this: “Availabil-
ity refers to the ability of a system to mask or repair faults such that the cumula-
tive service outage period does not exceed a required value over a specified time 
interval.” These definitions make the concept of failure subject to the judgment of 
an external agent, possibly a human. They also subsume concepts of reliability, 
confidentiality, integrity, and any other quality attribute that involves a concept of 
unacceptable failure. 
Availability is closely related to security. A denial-of-service attack is ex-
plicitly designed to make a system fail—that is, to make it unavailable. Availabil-
ity is also closely related to performance, because it may be difficult to tell when 
a system has failed and when it is simply being outrageously slow to respond. 
Finally, availability is closely allied with safety, which is concerned with keeping
