7.2  Tactics for Modifiability
Tactics to control modifiability have as their goal controlling the complexity of 
making changes, as well as the time and cost to make changes. Figure 7.2 shows 
this relationship.
To understand modifiability, we begin with coupling and cohesion.
Modules have responsibilities. When a change causes a module to be modi-
fied, its responsibilities are changed in some way. Generally, a change that affects 
one module is easier and less expensive than if it changes more than one mod-
ule. However, if two modules’ responsibilities overlap in some way, then a single 
change may well affect them both. We can measure this overlap by measuring the 
probability that a modification to one module will propagate to the other. This is 
called coupling, and high coupling is an enemy of modifiability.
Cohesion measures how strongly the responsibilities of a module are re-
lated. Informally, it measures the module’s “unity of purpose.” Unity of purpose 
can be measured by the change scenarios that affect a module. The cohesion of a 
module is the probability that a change scenario that affects a responsibility will 
also affect other (different) responsibilities. The higher the cohesion, the lower 
the probability that a given change will affect multiple responsibilities. High co-
hesion is good; low cohesion is bad. The definition allows for two modules with 
similar purposes each to be cohesive.
Given this framework, we can now identify the parameters that we will use 
to motivate modifiability tactics:
■
■Size of a module. Tactics that split modules will reduce the cost of making 
a modification to the module that is being split as long as the split is chosen 
to reflect the type of change that is likely to be made.
