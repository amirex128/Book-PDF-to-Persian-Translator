failure of similar systems in the past. Table 5.2, also taken from the NASA 
handbook, shows the data for a system of redundant amplifiers. Historical 
data shows that amplifiers fail most often when there is a short circuit or 
the circuit is left open, but there are several other failure modes as well 
(lumped together as “Other”).

GATE SYMBOLS
AND   Output fault occurs if all of the input faults occur
OR   Output fault occurs if a least one of the input faults occurs
COMBINATION   Output fault occurs if n of the input faults occur
EXCLUSIVE OR   Output fault occurs if exactly one of the input 
faults occurs
PRIORITY AND   Output fault occurs if all of the input faults occur in a 
specific sequence (the sequence is represented by a CONDITIONING 
EVENT drawn to the right of the gate)
INHIBIT   Output fault occurs if the (single) input fault occurs in the 
presence of an enabling condition (the enabling condition is represented 
by a CONDITIONING EVENT drawn to the right of the gate)
