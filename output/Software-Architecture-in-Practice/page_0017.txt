in detail from their underlying theory. We now present the theory first with 
specific methods given as illustrations of possible realizations of the theories. 
The new topics in this edition include architecture-centric project management; 
architecture competence; requirements modeling and analysis; Agile methods; 
implementation and testing; the cloud; and the edge.
As with the prior editions, we firmly believe that the topics are best discussed 
in either reading groups or in classroom settings, and to that end we have included 
a collection of discussion questions at the end of each chapter. Most of these 
questions are open-ended, with no absolute right or wrong answers, so you, as a 
reader, should emphasize how you justify your answer rather than just answer the 
question itself.
