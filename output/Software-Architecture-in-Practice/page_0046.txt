Why Is Software 
Architecture Important?
Software architecture is the set of design 
decisions which, if made incorrectly, may 
cause your project to be cancelled.
—Eoin Woods
If architecture is the answer, what was the question?
While Chapter 3 will cover the business importance of architecture to an 
enterprise, this chapter focuses on why architecture matters from a technical per-
spective. We will examine a baker’s dozen of the most important reasons.
1.	 An architecture will inhibit or enable a system’s driving quality attributes.
2.	 The decisions made in an architecture allow you to reason about and man-
age change as the system evolves.
3.	 The analysis of an architecture enables early prediction of a system’s 
qualities.
4.	 A documented architecture enhances communication among stakeholders.
5.	 The architecture is a carrier of the earliest and hence most fundamental, 
hardest-to-change design decisions.
6.	 An architecture defines a set of constraints on subsequent implementation.
7.	 The architecture dictates the structure of an organization, or vice versa.
8.	 An architecture can provide the basis for evolutionary prototyping.
9.	 An architecture is the key artifact that allows the architect and project man-
ager to reason about cost and schedule.
10.	 An architecture can be created as a transferable, reusable model that forms 
the heart of a product line.
11.	 Architecture-based development focuses attention on the assembly of com-
ponents, rather than simply on their creation.
12.	 By restricting design alternatives, architecture channels the creativity of 
developers, reducing design and system complexity.
13.	 An architecture can be the foundation for training a new team member.
