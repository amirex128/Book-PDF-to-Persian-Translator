What Is Software 
Architecture?
Good judgment is usually the result of experience. 
And experience is frequently the result of bad 
judgment. But to learn from the experience of 
others requires those who have the experience to 
share the knowledge with those who follow.
—Barry LePatner
Writing (on our part) and reading (on your part) a book about software architec-
ture, which distills the experience of many people, presupposes that 
1.	
having a software architecture is important to the successful development 
of a software system and 
2.	
there is a sufficient, and sufficiently generalizable, body of knowledge 
about software architecture to fill up a book.
One purpose of this book is to convince you that both of these assumptions are 
true, and once you are convinced, give you a basic knowledge so that you can 
apply it yourself.
Software systems are constructed to satisfy organizations’ business goals. 
The architecture is a bridge between those (often abstract) business goals and 
the final (concrete) resulting system. While the path from abstract goals to con-
crete systems can be complex, the good news is that software architectures can be 
designed, analyzed, documented, and implemented using known techniques that 
will support the achievement of these business and mission goals. The complex-
ity can be tamed, made tractable.
These, then, are the topics for this book: the design, analysis, documenta-
tion, and implementation of architectures. We will also examine the influences, 
principally in the form of business goals and quality attributes, which inform 
these activities.
