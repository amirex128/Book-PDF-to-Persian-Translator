Performance
An ounce of performance is worth pounds of promises.
—Mae West
It’s about time.
Performance, that is: It’s about time and the software system’s ability to meet 
timing requirements. When events occur—interrupts, messages, requests from 
users or other systems, or clock events marking the passage of time—the system, 
or some element of the system, must respond to them in time. Characterizing 
the events that can occur (and when they can occur) and the system or element’s 
time-based response to those events is the essence is discussing performance.
Web-based system events come in the form of requests from users (num-
bering in the tens or tens of millions) via their clients such as web browsers. In 
a control system for an internal combustion engine, events come from the opera-
tor’s controls and the passage of time; the system must control both the firing of 
the ignition when a cylinder is in the correct position and the mixture of the fuel 
to maximize power and efficiency and minimize pollution. 
For a web-based system, the desired response might be expressed as number 
of transactions that can be processed in a minute. For the engine control system, 
the response might be the allowable variation in the firing time. In each case, the 
pattern of events arriving and the pattern of responses can be characterized, and 
this characterization forms the language with which to construct performance 
scenarios.
For much of the history of software engineering, performance has been the 
driving factor in system architecture. As such, it has frequently compromised the 
achievement of all other qualities. As the price/performance ratio of hardware 
continues to plummet and the cost of developing software continues to rise, other 
qualities have emerged as important competitors to performance.
Nevertheless, all systems have performance requirements, even if they are 
not expressed. For example, a word processing tool may not have any explicit 
performance requirement, but no doubt everyone would agree that waiting an
