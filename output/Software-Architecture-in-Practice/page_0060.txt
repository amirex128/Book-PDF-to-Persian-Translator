The Many Contexts of 
Software Architecture
People in London think of London as the center 
of the world, whereas New Yorkers think the 
world ends three miles outside of Manhattan.
—Toby Young 
In 1976, a New Yorker magazine cover featured a cartoon by Saul Steinberg 
showing a New Yorker’s view of the world. You’ve probably seen it; if not, you 
can easily find it online. Looking to the west from 9th Avenue in Manhattan, the 
illustration shows 10th Avenue, then the wide Hudson River, then a thin strip 
of completely nondescript land called “Jersey,” followed by a somewhat thicker 
strip of land representing the entire rest of the United States. The mostly empty 
United States has a cartoon mountain or two here and there and a few cities hap-
hazardly placed “out there,” and is flanked by featureless “Canada” on the right 
and “Mexico” on the left. Beyond is the Pacific Ocean, only slightly wider than 
the Hudson, and beyond that lie tiny amorphous shapes for Japan and China and 
Russia, and that’s pretty much the world from a New Yorker’s perspective.
In a book about architecture, it is tempting to view architecture in the same 
way, as the most important piece of the software universe. And in some chapters, 
we unapologetically will do exactly that. But in this chapter we put software ar-
chitecture in its place, showing how it supports and is informed by other critical 
forces and activities in the various contexts in which it plays a role. 
These contexts, around which we structured this book, are as follows:
■
■Technical. What technical role does the software architecture play in the 
system or systems of which it’s a part? 
■
■Project life cycle. How does a software architecture relate to the other 
phases of a software development life cycle?
■
■Business. How does the presence of a software architecture affect an orga-
nization’s business environment?
