1.	
Build a spreadsheet for the steady-state availability equation MTBF / 
(MTBF + MTTR). Plug in different but reasonable values for MTBF and 
MTTR for each of the active redundancy, passive redundancy, and cold 
spare tactics. Try values for MTBF that are very large compared to MTTR, 
and also try values for MTBF that are much closer in size to MTTR. 
What do these tell you about which tactics you might want to choose for 
availability?
2.	
Enumerate as many responsibilities as you can that need to be carried out 
for providing a “cancel” operation in a user interface. Hint: There are at 
least 21 of them, as indicated in a publication by (strong hint!) one of the 
authors of this book whose last name (unbelievably strong hint!) begins 
with “B.”
3.	
The M/M/1 (look it up!) queuing model has been employed in computing 
systems for decades. Where in your favorite computing system would this 
model be appropriate to use to predict latency?
4.	
Suppose an architect produced Figure 14.5 while you were sitting watching 
him. Using thought experiments, how can you determine the performance 
and availability of this system? What assumptions are you making and what 
conclusions can you draw? How definite are your conclusions?
