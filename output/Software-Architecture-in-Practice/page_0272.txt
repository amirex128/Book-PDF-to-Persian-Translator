Quality Attribute 
Modeling and Analysis
Do not believe in anything simply because you have 
heard it . . . Do not believe in anything merely on 
the authority of your teachers and elders. Do not 
believe in traditions because they have been handed 
down for many generations. But after observation 
and analysis, when you find that anything agrees 
with reason and is conducive to the good and benefit 
of one and all, then accept it and live up to it.
—Prince Gautama Siddhartha
In Chapter  2 we listed thirteen reasons why architecture is important, worth 
studying, and worth practicing. Reason 6 is that the analysis of an architecture 
enables early prediction of a system’s qualities. This is an extraordinarily pow-
erful reason! Without it, we would be reduced to building systems by choosing 
various structures, implementing the system, measuring the system for its quality 
attribute responses, and all along the way hoping for the best. Architecture lets 
us do better than that, much better. We can analyze an architecture to see how 
the system or systems we build from it will perform with respect to their quality 
attribute goals, even before a single line of code has been written. This chapter 
will explore how.
The methods available depend, to a large extent, on the quality attribute to 
be analyzed. Some quality attributes, especially performance and availability, 
have well-understood and strongly validated analytic modeling techniques. Other 
quality attributes, for example security, can be analyzed through checklists. Still 
others can be analyzed through back-of-the-envelope calculations and thought 
experiments. 
Our topics in this chapter range from the specific, such as creating models 
and analyzing checklists, to the general, such as how to generate and carry out the 
thought experiments to perform early (and necessarily crude) analysis. Models
