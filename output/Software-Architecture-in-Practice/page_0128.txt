6.1  Interoperability General Scenario
The following are the portions of an interoperability general scenario:
■
■Source of stimulus. A system that initiates a request. 
■
■Stimulus. A request to exchange information among systems.
■
■Artifacts. The systems that wish to interoperate.
■
■Environment. The systems that wish to interoperate are discovered at run-
time or are known prior to runtime.
■
■Response. The request to interoperate results in the exchange of informa-
tion. The information is understood by the receiving party both syntactical-
ly and semantically. Alternatively, the request is rejected and appropriate 
entities are notified. In either case, the request may be logged.
■
■Response measure. The percentage of information exchanges correctly 
processed or the percentage of information exchanges correctly rejected.
Figure 6.1 gives an example: Our vehicle information system sends our cur-
rent location to the traffic monitoring system. The traffic monitoring system com-
bines our location with other information, overlays this information on a Goo-
gle Map, and broadcasts it. Our location information is correctly included with a 
probability of 99.9%.
Table 6.2 presents the possible values for each portion of an interoperability 
scenario.
