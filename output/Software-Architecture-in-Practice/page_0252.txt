Table 13.9  Shared-Data Pattern Solution
Overview
Communication between data accessors is mediated by a shared-
data store. Control may be initiated by the data accessors or the 
data store. Data is made persistent by the data store.
Elements
Shared-data store. Concerns include types of data stored, data 
performance-oriented properties, data distribution, and number of 
accessors permitted. 
Data accessor component. 
Data reading and writing connector. An important choice here is 
whether the connector is transactional or not, as well as the read/
write language, protocols, and semantics.
Relations
Attachment relation determines which data accessors are 
connected to which data stores.
Constraints
Data accessors interact with the data store(s). 
Weaknesses
The shared-data store may be a performance bottleneck.
The shared-data store may be a single point of failure.
Producers and consumers of data may be tightly coupled.
