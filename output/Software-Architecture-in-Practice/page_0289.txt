Part Two  Quality Attributes	
14—Quality Attribute Modeling and Analysis
A broad survey of architecture-centric performance evaluation approaches 
can be found in [Koziolek 10].
Security
Checklists for security have been generated by a variety of groups for different 
domains. See for example:
■
■Credit cards, generated by the Payment Card Industry: www.pcisecurity-
standards.org/security_standards/
■
■Information security, generated by the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST): [NIST 09].
■
■Electric grid, generated by Advanced Security Acceleration Project for the 
Smart Grid: www.smartgridipedia.org/index.php/ASAP-SG
■
■Common Criteria. An international standard (ISO/IEC 15408) for computer 
security certification: www.commoncriteriaportal.org
Testability
Work in measuring testability from an architectural perspective includes measur-
ing testability as the measured complexity of a class dependency graph derived 
from UML class diagrams, and identifying class diagrams that can lead to code 
that is difficult to test [Baudry 05]; and measuring controllability and observabil-
ity as a function of data flow [Le Traon 97]. 
Usability
A checklist for usability can be found at www.stcsig.org/usability/topics/articles/
he-checklist.html
Safety
A checklist for safety is called the Safety Integrity Level: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Safety_Integrity_Level
Applications of Modeling and Analysis
For a detailed discussion of a case where quality attribute modeling and analysis 
played a large role in determining the architecture as it evolved through a number 
of releases, see [Graham 07].
