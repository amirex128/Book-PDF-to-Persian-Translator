To express a quality attribute requirement, we use a quality attribute sce-
nario. The parts of the scenario are these:
1.	
Source of stimulus
2.	
Stimulus
3.	
Environment
4.	
Artifact
5.	
Response 
6.	
Response measure
An architectural tactic is a design decision that affects a quality attribute 
response. The focus of a tactic is on a single quality attribute response. Architec-
tural patterns can be seen as “packages” of tactics.
The seven categories of architectural design decisions are these:
1.	
Allocation of responsibilities
2.	
Coordination model
3.	
Data model
4.	
Management of resources
5.	
Mapping among architectural elements
6.	
Binding time decisions
7.	
Choice of technology

Philippe Kruchten [Kruchten 04] provides another categorization of design 
decisions.
Pena [Pena 87] uses categories of Function/Form/Economy/Time as a way 
of categorizing design decisions. 
Binding time and mechanisms to achieve different types of binding times 
are discussed in [Bachmann 05].
Taxonomies of quality attributes can be found in [Boehm 78], [McCall 77], 
and [ISO 11].
Arguments for viewing architecture as essentially independent from func-
tion can be found in [Shaw 95].

What is the relationship between a use case and a quality attribute scenario? 
If you wanted to add quality attribute information to a use case, how would 
you do it?
