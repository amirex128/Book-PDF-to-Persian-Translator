You will recall from Statistics 101 that:
■
■When two events A and B are independent, the probability that A or B will 
occur is the sum of the probability of each event: P(A or B) = P(A) 
+ P(B).
■
■When two events A and B are independent, the probability of both occur-
ring is P(A and B) = P(A) • P(B).
■
■When two events A and B are dependent, the probability of both occurring 
is P(A and B) = P(A) • P(B|A), where the last term means “the 
probability of B occurring, given that A occurs.”
