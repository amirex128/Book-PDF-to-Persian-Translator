Table 9.1  Security General Scenario
Portion of 
Scenario
Possible Values
Source
Human or another system which may have been previously 
identified (either correctly or incorrectly) or may be currently 
unknown. A human attacker may be from outside the organization or 
from inside the organization.
Stimulus
Unauthorized attempt is made to display data, change or delete 
data, access system services, change the system’s behavior, or 
reduce availability.
Artifact
System services, data within the system, a component or resources 
of the system, data produced or consumed by the system
Environment
The system is either online or offline; either connected to or 
disconnected from a network; either behind a firewall or open to a 
network; fully operational, partially operational, or not operational.
Response
Transactions are carried out in a fashion such that 
■
■
Data or services are protected from unauthorized access. 
■
■
Data or services are not being manipulated without authorization.
■
■
Parties to a transaction are identified with assurance. 
■
■
The parties to the transaction cannot repudiate their 
involvements. 
■
■
The data, resources, and system services will be available for 
legitimate use. 
The system tracks activities within it by
■
■
Recording access or modification 
■
■
Recording attempts to access data, resources, or services 
■
■
Notifying appropriate entities (people or systems) when an 
apparent attack is occurring
Response 
Measure
One or more of the following:
■
■
How much of a system is compromised when a particular 
component or data value is compromised
■
■
How much time passed before an attack was detected 
■
■
How many attacks were resisted 
■
■
How long does it take to recover from a successful attack 
■
■
How much data is vulnerable to a particular attack
9.2  Tactics for Security
One method for thinking about how to achieve security in a system is to think 
about physical security. Secure installations have limited access (e.g., by using 
security checkpoints), have means of detecting intruders (e.g., by requiring le-
gitimate visitors to wear badges), have deterrence mechanisms such as armed 
guards, have reaction mechanisms such as automatic locking of doors, and have 
recovery mechanisms such as off-site backup. These lead to our four categories 
of tactics: detect, resist, react, and recover. Figure 9.2 shows these categories as 
the goal of security tactics.
