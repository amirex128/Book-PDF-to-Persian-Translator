3—The Many Contexts of Software Architecture
■
■Business context. The architecture can affect the business goals of the 
developing organization. A successful system built from an architecture can 
enable a company to establish a foothold in a particular market segment—
think of the iPhone or Android app platforms as examples. The architecture 
can provide opportunities for the efficient production and deployment of 
similar systems, and the organization may adjust its goals to take advantage 
of its newfound expertise to plumb the market. This is feedback from the 
system to the developing organization and the systems it builds.
■
■Professional context. The process of system building will affect the 
architect’s experience with subsequent systems by adding to the corporate 
experience base. A system that was successfully built around a particular 
technical approach will make the architect more inclined to build systems 
using the same approach in the future. On the other hand, architectures that 
fail are less likely to be chosen for future projects.
These and other feedback mechanisms form what we call the Architecture 
Influence Cycle, or AIC, illustrated in Figure 3.5, which depicts the influences of 
the culture and business of the development organization on the software archi-
tecture. That architecture is, in turn, a primary determinant of the properties of 
the developed system or systems. But the AIC is also based on a recognition that 
shrewd organizations can take advantage of the organizational and experiential 
effects of developing an architecture and can use those effects to position their 
business strategically for future projects.
