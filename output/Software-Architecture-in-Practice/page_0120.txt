All of the availability tactics involve the coordination model because the 
coordination model must be aware of faults that occur to generate an appropriate 
response.

Patterns for availability:
■
■You can find patterns for fault tolerance in [Hanmer 07]. 
Tactics for availability, overall:
■
■A more detailed discussion of some of the availability tactics in this chapter is 
given in [Scott 09]. This is the source of much of the material in this chapter.
■
■The Internet Engineering Task Force has promulgated a number of stan-
dards supporting availability tactics. These standards include non-stop for-
warding [IETF 04], ping/echo ICMPv6 [IETF 06b], echo request/response), 
and MPLS (LSP Ping) networks [IETF 06a].
Tactics for availability, fault detection:
■
■The parameter fence tactic was first used (to our knowledge) in the Control 
Data Series computers of the late 1960s. 
■
■Triple modular redundancy (TMR), part of the voting tactic, was developed 
in the early 1960s by Lyons [Lyons 62].
■
■The fault detection tactic of voting is based on the fundamental contribu-
tions to automata theory by Von Neumann, who demonstrated how systems 
having a prescribed reliability could be built from unreliable components 
[Von Neumann 56]. 
Tactics for availability, fault recovery:
■
■Standards-based realizations of active redundancy exist for protecting net-
work links (i.e., facilities) at both the physical layer [Bellcore 99, Telcordia 
00] and the network/link layer [IETF 05].
■
■Exception handlinghas been written about by [Powel Douglass 99]. Soft-
ware can then use this information to mask the fault, usually by correcting 
the cause of the exception and retrying the operation.
■
■[Morelos-Zaragoza 06] and [Schneier 96] have written about the compari-
son of state during resynchronization. 
■
■Some examples of how a system can degrade through use (degradation) are 
given in [Nygard 07].
■
■[Utas 05] has written about escalating restart.
