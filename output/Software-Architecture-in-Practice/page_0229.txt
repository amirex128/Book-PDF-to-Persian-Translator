relationships among the boxes. Here, everything is allowed to use every-
thing. This is decidedly not a layered architecture. The reason is that if 
Layer A is replaced by a different version, Layer C (which uses it in this fig-
ure) might well have to change. We don’t want our virtual machine layer to 
change every time our application layer changes. But I’m still surprised at 
how many people call a stack of boxes lined up with each other “layers” (or 
think that layers are the same as tiers in a multi-tier architecture).

Software in a layer is allowed to use software 
in the same layer, or any layer immediately 
below or to the right.
