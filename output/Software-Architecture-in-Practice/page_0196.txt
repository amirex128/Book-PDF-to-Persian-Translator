Usability
Any darn fool can make something complex; it 
takes a genius to make something simple.
—Albert Einstein
Usability is concerned with how easy it is for the user to accomplish a desired 
task and the kind of user support the system provides. Over the years, a focus on 
usability has shown itself to be one of the cheapest and easiest ways to improve a 
system’s quality (or more precisely, the user’s perception of quality). 
Usability comprises the following areas:
■
■Learning system features. If the user is unfamiliar with a particular system 
or a particular aspect of it, what can the system do to make the task of 
learning easier? This might include providing help features.
■
■Using a system efficiently. What can the system do to make the user more 
efficient in its operation? This might include the ability for the user to redi-
rect the system after issuing a command. For example, the user may wish to 
suspend one task, perform several operations, and then resume that task.
■
■Minimizing the impact of errors. What can the system do so that a user 
error has minimal impact? For example, the user may wish to cancel a com-
mand issued incorrectly.
■
■Adapting the system to user needs. How can the user (or the system itself) 
adapt to make the user’s task easier? For example, the system may automat-
ically fill in URLs based on a user’s past entries.
■
■Increasing confidence and satisfaction. What does the system do to give the 
user confidence that the correct action is being taken? For example, pro-
viding feedback that indicates that the system is performing a long-running 
task and the extent to which the task is completed will increase the user’s 
confidence in the system.
