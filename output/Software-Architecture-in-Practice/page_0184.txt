10.1  Testability General Scenario
163
Table 10.1 enumerates the elements of the general scenario that characterize 
testability.
Table 10.1  Testability General Scenario
Portion of Scenario
Possible Values
Source
Unit testers, integration testers, system testers, acceptance 
testers, end users, either running tests manually or using 
automated testing tools
Stimulus 
A set of tests is executed due to the completion of a coding 
increment such as a class layer or service, the completed 
integration of a subsystem, the complete implementation of the 
whole system, or the delivery of the system to the customer.
Environment 
Design time, development time, compile time, integration time, 
deployment time, run time
Artifacts 
The portion of the system being tested
Response 
One or more of the following: execute test suite and capture 
results, capture activity that resulted in the fault, control and 
monitor the state of the system 
Response Measure 
One or more of the following: effort to find a fault or class of 
faults, effort to achieve a given percentage of state space 
coverage, probability of fault being revealed by the next 
test, time to perform tests, effort to detect faults, length of 
longest dependency chain in test, length of time to prepare 
test environment, reduction in risk exposure (size(loss) × 
prob(loss))
