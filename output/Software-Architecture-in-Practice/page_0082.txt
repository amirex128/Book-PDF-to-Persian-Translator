Part  T WO
Quality Attributes
In Part II, we provide the technical foundations for you to design or analyze an 
architecture to achieve particular quality attributes. We do not discuss design or 
analysis processes here; we cover those topics in Part III. It is impossible, how-
ever, to understand how to improve the performance of a design, for example, 
without understanding something about performance. 
In Chapter 4 we describe how to specify a quality attribute requirement and 
motivate design techniques called tactics to enable you to achieve a particular qual-
ity attribute requirement. We also enumerate seven categories of design decisions. 
These are categories of decisions that are universally important, and so we provide 
material to help an architect focus on these decisions. In Chapter 4, we describe 
these categories, and in each of the following chapters devoted to a particular quality 
attribute—Chapters 5–11—we use those categories to develop a checklist that tells 
you how to focus your attention on the important aspects associated with that quality 
attribute. Many of the items in our checklists may seem obvious, but the purpose of 
a checklist is to help ensure the completeness of your design and analysis process.
In addition to providing a treatment of seven specific quality attributes 
(availability, interoperability, modifiability, performance, security, testability, and 
usability), we also describe how you can generate the material provided in Chap-
ters 5–11 for other quality attributes that we have not covered.
Architectural patterns provide known solutions to a number of common 
problems in design. In Chapter 13, we present some of the most important pat-
terns and discuss the relationship between patterns and tactics.
Being able to analyze a design for a particular quality attribute is a key skill 
that you as an architect will need to acquire. In Chapter 14, we discuss modeling 
techniques for some of the quality attributes.
