5—Availability
Figure 5.3 shows a concrete scenario generated from the general scenario: The 
heartbeat monitor determines that the server is nonresponsive during normal opera-
tions. The system informs the operator and continues to operate with no downtime.
Table 5.3  Availability General Scenario 
Portion of 
Scenario
Possible Values
Source
Internal/external: people, hardware, software, physical infrastructure, 
physical environment
Stimulus
Fault: omission, crash, incorrect timing, incorrect response
Artifact
Processors, communication channels, persistent storage, processes
Environment Normal operation, startup, shutdown, repair mode, degraded operation, 
overloaded operation
Response
Prevent the fault from becoming a failure
Detect the fault:
■
■
Log the fault
■
■
Notify appropriate entities (people or systems)
Recover from the fault:
■
■
Disable source of events causing the fault
■
■
Be temporarily unavailable while repair is being effected
■
■
Fix or mask the fault/failure or contain the damage it causes
■
■
Operate in a degraded mode while repair is being effected
Response 
Measure
Time or time interval when the system must be available
Availability percentage (e.g., 99.999%)
Time to detect the fault
Time to repair the fault
Time or time interval in which system can be in degraded mode
Proportion (e.g., 99%) or rate (e.g., up to 100 per second) of a certain 
class of faults that the system prevents, or handles without failing
Stimulus:
Server
