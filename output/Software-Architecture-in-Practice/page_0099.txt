Part Two  Quality Attributes	
4—Understanding Quality Attributes
2.	
Do you suppose that the set of tactics for a quality attribute is finite or in-
finite? Why?
3.	
Discuss the choice of programming language (an example of choice of 
technology) and its relation to architecture in general, and the design 
decisions in the other six categories? For instance, how can certain pro-
gramming languages enable or inhibit the choice of particular coordination 
models?
4.	
We will be using the automatic teller machine as an example throughout 
the chapters on quality attributes. Enumerate the set of responsibilities that 
an automatic teller machine should support and propose an initial design to 
accommodate that set of responsibilities. Justify your proposal.
5.	
Think about the screens that your favorite automatic teller machine uses. 
What do those screens tell you about binding time decisions reflected in the 
architecture?
6.	
Consider the choice between synchronous and asynchronous communica-
tion (a choice in the coordination mechanism category). What quality attri-
bute requirements might lead you to choose one over the other?
7.	
Consider the choice between stateful and stateless communication (a choice 
in the coordination mechanism category). What quality attribute require-
ments might lead you to choose one over the other?
8.	
Most peer-to-peer architecture employs late binding of the topology. What 
quality attributes does this promote or inhibit?
