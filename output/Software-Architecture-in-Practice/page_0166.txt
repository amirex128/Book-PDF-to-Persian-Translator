8.4  Summary
Performance is about the management of system resources in the face of partic-
ular types of demand to achieve acceptable timing behavior. Performance can be 
measured in terms of throughput and latency for both interactive and embedded 
real-time systems, although throughput is usually more important in interactive 
systems, and latency is more important in embedded systems.
Performance can be improved by reducing demand or by managing re-
sources more appropriately. Reducing demand will have the side effect of re-
ducing fidelity or refusing to service some requests. Managing resources more 
appropriately can be done through scheduling, replication, or just increasing the 
resources available.
8.5  For Further Reading
Performance has a rich body of literature. Here are some books we recommend:
■
■Software Performance and Scalability: A Quantitative Approach [Liu 09]. 
This books covers performance geared toward enterprise applications, with 
an emphasis on queuing theory and measurement.
■
■Performance Solutions: A Practical Guide to Creating Responsive, Scal-
able Software [Smith 01]. This book covers designing with performance in 
mind, with emphasis on building (and populating with real data) practical 
predictive performance models.
■
■Real-Time Design Patterns: Robust Scalable Architecture for Real-Time 
Systems [Douglass 99].
■
■Real-Time Systems [Liu 00]. 
■
■Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture Volume 3: Patterns for Resource 
Management [Kircher 03].
