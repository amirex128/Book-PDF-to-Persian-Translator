Thought experiments and back-of-the-envelope analysis can often quickly 
help find problems or confirm the nonexistence of problems with respect to qual-
ity attribute requirements. A thought experiment may consider several of the 
quality attribute requirements simultaneously; typically it will focus on just the 
most important ones. Experiments, simulations, and prototypes allow the explo-
ration of tradeoffs, by helping to turn unknown architectural parameters into con-
stants or ranges whose values may be measured rather than estimated. 
Depending on your project’s state of development, different forms of analy-
sis are possible. Each form of analysis comes with its own costs and its own level 
of confidence associated with each analysis technique.

There have been many papers and books published describing how to build and 
analyze architectural models for quality attributes. Here are just a few examples.
Availability
Many availability models have been proposed that operate at the architecture 
level of analysis. Just a few of these are [Gokhale 05] and [Yacoub 02].
A discussion and comparison of different black-box and white-box models 
for determining software reliability can be found in [Chandran 10].
A book relating availability to disaster recovery and business recovery is 
[Schmidt 10].
Interoperability
An overview of interoperability activities can be found in [Brownsword 04].
Modifiability
Modifiability is typically measured through complexity metrics. The classic work 
on this topic is [Chidamber 94].
More recently, analyses based on design structure matrices have begun to 
appear [MacCormack 06].
Performance
Two of the classic works on software performance evaluation are [Smith 01] and 
[Klein 93].
