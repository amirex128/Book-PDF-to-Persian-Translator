  <h4>Preface</h4>
  <p>
   I should have no objection to go over the same life from its beginning to the
   end: requesting only the advantage authors have, of correcting in a [third]
   edition the faults of the first [two].
   <br>
   — Benjamin Franklin
  </p>
  <p>
   It has been a decade since the publication of the second edition of this book.
   During that time, the field of <strong>software architecture</strong> has broadened
   its focus from being primarily internally oriented—How does one design,
   evaluate, and document software?—to including external impacts as well—a
   deeper understanding of the influences on architectures and a deeper
   understanding of the impact architectures have on the life cycle,
   organizations, and management.
  </p>
  <p>
   The past ten years have also seen dramatic changes in the types of systems
   being constructed. Large data, social media, and the cloud are all areas that,
   at most, were embryonic ten years ago and now are not only mature but
   extremely influential.
  </p>
  <p>
   We listened to some of the criticisms of the previous editions and have
   included much more material on patterns, reorganized the material on quality
   attributes, and made interoperability a quality attribute worthy of its own
   chapter. We also provide guidance about how you can generate scenarios and
   tactics for your own favorite quality attributes.
  </p>
  <p>
   To accommodate this plethora of new material, we had to make difficult
   choices. In particular, this edition of the book does not include extended
   case studies as the prior editions did. This decision also reflects the maturing
   of the field, in the sense that case studies about the choices made in
   <strong>software architectures</strong> are more prevalent than they were ten years
   ago, and they are less necessary to convince readers of the importance of
   <strong>software architecture</strong>. The case studies from the first two editions
   are available, however, on the book’s website, at
   <a href="www.informit.com/title/9780321815736">www.informit.com/title/9780321815736</a>.
   In addition, on the same website, we have slides that will assist instructors
   in presenting this material.
  </p>
  <p>
   We have thoroughly reworked many of the topics covered in this edition. In
   particular, we realize that the methods we present—for architecture design,
   analysis, and documentation—are one version of how to achieve a particular
   goal, but there are others. This led us to separate the methods that we present
