Checklist
Coordination 
Model
Determine mechanisms required to communicate and coordinate 
with other systems or individuals. For these communications, 
ensure that mechanisms for authenticating and authorizing the 
actor or system, and encrypting data for transmission across 
the connection, are in place. Ensure also that mechanisms exist 
for monitoring and recognizing unexpectedly high demands for 
resources or services as well as mechanisms for restricting or 
terminating the connection.
Data Model
Determine the sensitivity of different data fields. For each data 
abstraction:
■
■
Ensure that data of different sensitivity is separated.
■
■
Ensure that data of different sensitivity has different access 
rights and that access rights are checked prior to access.
■
■
Ensure that access to sensitive data is logged and that the log 
file is suitably protected.
■
■
Ensure that data is suitably encrypted and that keys are 
separated from the encrypted data.
■
■
Ensure that data can be restored if it is inappropriately 
modified.
Mapping among 
Architectural 
Elements
Determine how alternative mappings of architectural elements 
that are under consideration may change how an individual or 
system may read, write, or modify data; access system services or 
resources; or reduce availability to system services or resources. 
Determine how alternative mappings may affect the recording 
of access to data, services or resources and the recognition of 
unexpectedly high demands for resources.
For each such mapping, ensure that there are responsibilities to do 
the following:
■
■
Identify an actor
■
■
Authenticate an actor
■
■
Authorize actors
■
■
Grant or deny access to data or services
■
■
Record attempts to access or modify data or services
■
■
Encrypt data
■
■
Recognize reduced availability for resources or services, inform 
appropriate personnel, and restrict access
■
■
Recover from an attack
Resource 
Management
Determine the system resources required to identify and monitor 
a system or an individual who is internal or external, authorized or 
not authorized, with access to specific resources or all resources.
Determine the resources required to authenticate the actor, grant 
or deny access to data or resources, notify appropriate entities 
(people or systems), record attempts to access data or resources, 
encrypt data, recognize inexplicably high demand for resources, 
inform users or systems, and restrict access. 
For these resources consider whether an external entity can 
access a critical resource or exhaust a critical resource; how to 
monitor the resource; how to manage resource utilization; how 
to log resource utilization; and ensure that there are sufficient 
resources to perform the necessary security operations.
Ensure that a contaminated element can be prevented from 
contaminating other elements.
Ensure that shared resources are not used for passing sensitive 
data from an actor with access rights to that data to an actor 
without access rights to that data.
