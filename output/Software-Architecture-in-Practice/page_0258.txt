Table 13.11  Multi-tier Pattern Solution
Overview
The execution structures of many systems are organized as a 
set of logical groupings of components. Each grouping is termed 
a tier. The grouping of components into tiers may be based on a 
variety of criteria, such as the type of component, sharing the same 
execution environment, or having the same runtime purpose.
Elements
Tier, which is a logical grouping of software components. 
Tiers may be formed on the basis of common computing platforms, 
in which case those platforms are also elements of the pattern.
Relations
Is part of, to group components into tiers.
Communicates with, to show how tiers and the components they 
contain interact with each other. 
Allocated to, in the case that tiers map to computing platforms. 
Constraints
A software component belongs to exactly one tier.
Weaknesses
Substantial up-front cost and complexity.
