6—Interoperability
Table 6.2  General Interoperability Scenario
Portion of Scenario Possible Values
Source
A system initiates a request to interoperate with another 
system.
Stimulus
A request to exchange information among system(s).
Artifact
The systems that wish to interoperate.
Environment
System(s) wishing to interoperate are discovered at runtime or 
known prior to runtime.
Response
One or more of the following:
■
■
The request is (appropriately) rejected and appropriate 
entities (people or systems) are notified.
■
■
The request is (appropriately) accepted and information is 
exchanged successfully.
■
■
The request is logged by one or more of the involved 
systems.
Response Measure
One or more of the following:
■
■
Percentage of information exchanges correctly processed 
■
■
Percentage of information exchanges correctly rejected 
SOAP vs. REST
If you want to allow web-based applications to interoperate, you have 
two major off-the-shelf technology options today: (1) WS* and SOAP 
(which once stood for “Simple Object Access Protocol,” but that acronym 
is no longer blessed) and (2) REST (which stands for “Representation 
State Transfer,” and therefore is sometimes spelled ReST). How can we 
compare these technologies? What is each good for? What are the road 
hazards you need to be aware of? This is a bit of an apples-and-oranges 
comparison, but I will try to sketch the landscape. 
SOAP is a protocol specification for XML-based information that distrib-
uted applications can use to exchange information and hence interoperate. 
It is most often accompanied by a set of SOA middleware interoperability 
standards and compliant implementations, referred to (collectively) as WS*. 
SOAP and WS* together define many standards, including the following:
■
■
An infrastructure for service composition. SOAP can employ the Business 
Process Execution Language (BPEL) as a way to let developers express 
business processes that are implemented as WS* services. 
■
■
Transactions. There are several web-service standards for ensuring 
that transactions are properly managed: WS-AT, WS-BA, WS-CAF, and 
WS-Transaction.
■
■
Service discovery. The Universal Description, Discovery and Integration 
(UDDI) language enables businesses to publish service listings and 
discover each other.
