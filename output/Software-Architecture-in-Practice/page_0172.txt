Detect Attacks
The detect attacks category consists of four tactics: detect intrusion, detect service 
denial, verify message integrity, and detect message delay.
■
■Detect intrusion is the comparison of network traffic or service request 
patterns within a system to a set of signatures or known patterns of 
malicious behavior stored in a database. The signatures can be based on 
protocol, TCP flags, payload sizes, applications, source or destination 
address, or port number.
■
■Detect service denial is the comparison of the pattern or signature of 
network traffic coming into a system to historic profiles of known denial-of-
service attacks. 
■
■Verify message integrity. This tactic employs techniques such as 
checksums or hash values to verify the integrity of messages, resource 
files, deployment files, and configuration files. A checksum is a validation 
mechanism wherein the system maintains redundant information for 
configuration files and messages, and uses this redundant information 
to verify the configuration file or message when it is used. A hash value 
is a unique string generated by a hashing function whose input could be 
configuration files or messages. Even a slight change in the original files or 
messages results in a significant change in the hash value.
■
■Detect message delay is intended to detect potential man-in-the-middle 
attacks, where a malicious party is intercepting (and possibly modifying) 
messages. By checking the time that it takes to deliver a message, it is 
possible to detect suspicious timing behavior, where the time it takes to 
deliver a message is highly variable.
