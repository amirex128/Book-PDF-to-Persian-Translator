round-robin is a cyclic executive, where assignment possibilities are 
at fixed time intervals.

Earliest-deadline-first. Earliest-deadline-first. Earliest-deadline-first 
assigns priorities based on the pending requests with the earliest 
deadline.
■
■
Least-slack-first. This strategy assigns the highest priority to the job 
having the least “slack time,” which is the difference between the exe-
cution time remaining and the time to the job’s deadline.
For a single processor and processes that are preemptible (that is, it is 
possible to suspend processing of one task in order to service a task 
whose deadline is drawing near), both the earliest-deadline and least-
slack scheduling strategies are optimal. That is, if the set of processes can 
be scheduled so that all deadlines are met, then these strategies will be 
able to schedule that set successfully.

■
Static scheduling. A cyclic executive schedule is a scheduling strategy 
where the preemption points and the sequence of assignment to the 
resource are determined offline. The runtime overhead of a scheduler is 
thereby obviated.
