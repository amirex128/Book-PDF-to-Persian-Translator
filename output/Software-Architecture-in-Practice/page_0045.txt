Part One  Introduction	
1—What Is Software Architecture?
6.	
Find a commonly accepted definition of system architecture and discuss 
what it has in common with software architecture. Do the same for enter-
prise architecture.
7.	
Find a published example of an architecture. What structure or structures 
are shown? Given its purpose, what structure or structures should have 
been shown? What analysis does the architecture support? Critique it: What 
questions do you have that the representation does not answer?
8.	
Sailing ships have architectures, which means they have “structures” that 
lend themselves to reasoning about the ship’s performance and other qual-
ity attributes. Look up the technical definitions for barque, brig, cutter, 
frigate, ketch, schooner, and sloop. Propose a useful set of “structures” for 
distinguishing and reasoning about ship architectures.
