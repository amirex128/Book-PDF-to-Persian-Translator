compile a list of quality attributes that refer to some form of modifiability. 
Discuss the differences.
2.	
For each quality attribute that you discovered as a result of the previous 
question, write a modifiability scenario that expresses it.
3.	
In a certain metropolitan subway system, the ticket machines accept cash 
but do not give change. There is a separate machine that dispenses change 
but does not sell tickets. In an average station there are six or eight ticket 
machines for every change machine. What modifiability tactics do you see 
at work in this arrangement? What can you say about availability?
4.	
For the subway system in the previous question, describe the specific form 
of modifiability (using a modifiability scenario) that seems to be the aim of 
arranging the ticket and change machines as described.
5.	
A wrapper is a common aid to modifiability. A wrapper for a component 
is the only element allowed to use that component; every other piece of 
software uses the component’s services by going through the wrapper. The 
wrapper transforms the data or control information for the component it 
wraps. For example, a component may expect input using English measures 
but find itself in a system in which all of the other components produce 
metric measures. A wrapper could be employed to translate. What modifi-
ability tactics does a wrapper embody?
6.	
Once an intermediary has been introduced into an architecture, some mod-
ules may attempt to circumvent it, either inadvertently (because they are 
not aware of the intermediary) or intentionally (for performance, for conve-
nience, or out of habit). Discuss some architectural means to prevent inad-
vertent circumvention of an intermediary.
7.	
In some projects, deployability is an important quality attribute that mea-
sures how easy it is to get a new version of the system into the hands of its 
users. This might mean a trip to your auto dealer or transmitting updates 
over the Internet. It also includes the time it takes to install the update once 
it arrives. In projects that measure deployability separately, should the cost 
of a modification stop when the new version is ready to ship? Justify your 
answer.
8.	
The abstract common services tactic is intended to reduce coupling, but it 
also might reduce cohesion. Discuss.
9.	
Identify particular change scenarios for an automatic teller machine. What 
modifications would you make to your automatic teller machine design to 
accommodate these changes?
