■It compresses the time required for the method. Time on site for remote 
participants is minimized, although as we will see, travel time is not con-
sidered in this argument. All of the stakeholders are available with minimal 
external distractions.
■
■It emphasizes the importance of the method. Any meeting important 
enough to bring multiple people together for an extended time must be 
judged by management to be important. 
■
■It benefits from the helpful group mentality that emerges when people are 
in the same room working toward a common goal. The group mentality 
fosters buy-in to the architecture and buy-in to the reasons it exists. Putting 
stakeholders in the same room lets them open communication paths with 
the architect and with each other, paths that will often remain open long 
Model
Advantages
Disadvantages
All stakeholders in 
the same room for 
the duration of the 
exercise (co-located 
and synchronous). 
All stakeholders participate 
equally.
Group mentality produces 
buy-in for architecture and 
the results of the exercise.
Enduring communication 
paths are opened among 
stakeholders.
This option takes the 
shortest calendar time.
Scheduling can be 
problematic.
Some stakeholders might not 
be forthcoming in a crowd.
Stakeholders might incur 
substantial travel costs to 
attend.
Some stakeholders 
participate in exercise 
remotely (distributed 
and synchronous). 
Saves travel costs for remote 
participants; this option 
might permit participation by 
stakeholders who otherwise 
would not be able to 
contribute.
Technology is a limiting 
factor; remote participants 
almost always are second-
class citizens in terms of 
their participation and after-
exercise “connection” to other 
participants.
Facilitators 
interviewing 
stakeholders 
individually or in small 
groups (distributed 
and asynchronous).
Allows for in-depth 
interaction between 
facilitators and stakeholders.
Eliminates group factors that 
might inhibit a stakeholder 
from speaking in public.
If stakeholders are widely 
distributed, increased travel 
costs incurred by facilitator(s).
Reduced group buy-in.
Reduced group mentality.
Reduced after-exercise 
communication among 
stakeholders.
Exercise stretched out over a 
longer period of calendar time.
