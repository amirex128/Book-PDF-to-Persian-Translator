1.2  Architectural Structures and Views
The neurologist, the orthopedist, the hematologist, and the dermatologist all have 
different views of the structure of a human body. Ophthalmologists, cardiolo-
gists, and podiatrists concentrate on specific subsystems. And the kinesiologist 
and psychiatrist are concerned with different aspects of the entire arrangement’s 
behavior. Although these views are pictured differently and have very different 
properties, all are inherently related, interconnected: together they describe the 
architecture of the human body. Figure 1.1 shows several different views of the 
human body: the skeletal, the vascular, and the X-ray.

So it is with software. Modern systems are frequently too complex to grasp 
all at once. Instead, we restrict our attention at any one moment to one (or a 
small number) of the software system’s structures. To communicate meaningfully 
about an architecture, we must make clear which structure or structures we are 
discussing at the moment—which view we are taking of the architecture.
