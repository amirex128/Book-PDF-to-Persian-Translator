Allocation of 
Responsibilities
Ensure that additional system responsibilities have been 
allocated, as needed, to assist the user in the following:
■
■
Learning how to use the system
■
■
Efficiently achieving the task at hand 
■
■
Adapting and configuring the system
■
■
Recovering from user and system errors
Coordination Model
Determine whether the properties of system elements’ 
coordination—timeliness, currency, completeness, 
correctness, consistency—affect how a user learns to use 
the system, achieves goals or completes tasks, adapts 
and configures the system, recovers from user and system 
errors, and gains increased confidence and satisfaction. 
For example, can the system respond to mouse events 
and give semantic feedback in real time? Can long-running 
events be canceled in a reasonable amount of time?
