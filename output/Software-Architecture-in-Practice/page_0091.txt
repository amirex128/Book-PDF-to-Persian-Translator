Part Two  Quality Attributes	
4—Understanding Quality Attributes
4.5  Achieving Quality Attributes through Tactics
The quality attribute requirements specify the responses of the system that, with a 
bit of luck and a dose of good planning, realize the goals of the business. We now 
turn to the techniques an architect can use to achieve the required quality attri-
butes. We call these techniques architectural tactics. A tactic is a design decision 
that influences the achievement of a quality attribute response—tactics directly 
affect the system’s response to some stimulus. Tactics impart portability to one 
design, high performance to another, and integrability to a third.
