Part Two  Quality Attributes	
6—Interoperability
6.5  For Further Reading
An SEI report gives a good overview of interoperability, and it highlights some of 
the “maturity frameworks” for interoperability [Brownsword 04].
The various WS* services are being developed under the auspices of the 
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and can be found at www.w3.org/2002/ws.
Systems of systems are of particular interest to the U.S. Department of De-
fense. An engineering guide can be found at [ODUSD 08].
6.6  Discussion Questions
1.	
Find a web service mashup. Write several concrete interoperability scenari-
os for this system.
2.	
What is the relationship between interoperability and the other quality 
attributes highlighted in this book? For example, if two systems fail to ex-
change information properly, could a security flaw result? What other quali-
ty attributes seem strongly related (at least potentially) to interoperability? 
3.	
Is a service-oriented system a system of systems? If so, describe a ser-
vice-oriented system that is directed, one that is acknowledged, one that is 
collaborative, and one that is virtual.
4.	
Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI) was touted as a 
discovery service, but commercial support for UDDI is being withdrawn. 
Why do you suppose this is? Does it have anything to do with the quality 
attributes delivered or not delivered by UDDI solutions?
5.	
Why has the importance of orchestration grown in recent years?
6.	
If you are a technology producer, what are the advantages and disadvan-
tages of adhering to interoperability standards? Why would a producer not 
adhere to a standard?
7.	
With what other systems will an automatic teller machine need to interoper-
ate? How would you change your automatic teller system design to accom-
modate these other systems?
