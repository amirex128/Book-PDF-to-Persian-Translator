Part Two  Quality Attributes	
14—Quality Attribute Modeling and Analysis
We can apply simple probability arithmetic to an architecture pattern for 
availability to determine the probability of failure of the pattern given the proba-
bility of failure of the individual components (and an understanding of their de-
pendency relations). For example, in an architecture pattern employing the pas-
sive redundancy tactic, let’s assume that the failure of a component (which at any 
moment might be acting as either the primary or backup copy) is independent of 
a failure of its counterpart, and that the probability of failure of either is the same. 
Then the probability that both will fail is F = (1 – a) **2, where a is the 
availability of an individual component (assuming that failures are independent). 
Still other models take into account different levels of failure severity and 
degraded operating states of the system. Although the derivation of these for-
mulas is outside the scope of this chapter, you end up with formulas that look 
like the following for the three redundancy tactics we’ve been discussing, where 
the values C2 through C5 are references to the MTBF column of Table 14.1, D2 
through D4 refer to the Active column, E2 through E3 refer to the Passive col-
umn, and F2 through F3 refer to the Spare column.

■Active redundancy:
■
■Availability(MTTR): 1 –((SUM(C2:C5) + D3) × D2)/((C2 × (C2 + C4 + 
D3) + ((C2 + C4 + D2) × (C3 + C5)) + ((C2 + C4) × (C2 + C4 + D3))))
■
■P(Degraded) = ((C3 + C5) × D2)/((C2 × (C2 + C4 + D3) + ((C2 + C4 + 
D2) × (C3 + C5)) + ((C2 + C4) × (C2 + C4 + D3))))
■
■Passive redundancy:
■
■Availability(MTTR_passive) = 1 – ((SUM(C2:C5) + E3) × E2)/((C2 × 
(C2 + C4 + E3) + ((C2 + C4 + E2) × (C3 + C5)) + ((C2 + C4) × (C2 + 
C4 + E3))))
■
■P(Degraded) = ((C3 + C5) × E2)/((C2 × (C2 + C4 + E3) + ((C2 + C4 + 
E2) × (C3 + C5)) + ((C2 + C4) × (C2 + C4 + E3))))
■
■Spare:
■
■Availability(MTTR) = 1 – ((SUM(C2:C5) + F3) × F2)/((C2 × (C2 + C4 + 
F3) + ((C2 + C4 + F2) × (C3 + C5)) + ((C2 + C4) × (C2 + C4 + F3))))
■
■P(Degraded) = ((C3 + C5) × F2)/((C2 × (C2 + C4 + F3) + ((C2 + C4 + 
F2) × (C3 + C5)) + ((C2 + C4) × (C2 + C4 + F3)))) 
Plugging in these values for the parameters to the equations listed above 
results in a table like Table 14.1, which can be easily calculated using any spread-
sheet tool. Such a calculation can help in the selection of tactics.
