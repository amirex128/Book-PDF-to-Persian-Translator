Architecture and 
Requirements
The two most important requirements for major 
success are: first, being in the right place at the 
right time, and second, doing something about it.
—Ray Kroc
Architectures exist to build systems that satisfy requirements. That’s obvious. 
What may be less obvious is that, to an architect, not all requirements are created 
equal. Some have a much more profound effect on the architecture than others. 
An architecturally significant requirement (ASR) is a requirement that will have 
a profound effect on the architecture—that is, the architecture might well be dra-
matically different in the absence of such a requirement. 
You cannot hope to design a successful architecture if you do not know the 
ASRs. ASRs often, but not always, take the form of quality attribute require-
ments—the performance, security, modifiability, availability, usability, and so 
forth, that the architecture must provide to the system. In Chapters 5–13 we in-
troduced patterns and tactics to achieve quality attributes. Each time you select 
a pattern or tactic to use in your architecture, you are changing the architecture 
as a result of the need to meet quality attribute requirements. The more difficult 
and important the QA requirement, the more likely it is to significantly affect the 
architecture, and hence to be an ASR. 
Architects have to identify ASRs, usually after doing a significant bit of 
work to uncover candidate ASRs. Competent architects know this, and as we ob-
serve experienced architects going about their duties, we notice that the first thing 
they do is start talking to the important stakeholders. They’re gathering the in-
formation they need to produce the architecture that will respond to the project’s 
needs—whether or not this information has already been identified. 
This chapter provides some systematic means for identifying the ASRs and 
other factors that will shape the architecture.
