11.4  Summary
Architectural support for usability involves both allowing the user to take the ini-
tiative—in circumstances such as canceling a long-running command or undoing 
a completed command—and aggregating data and commands. 
To be able to predict user or system responses, the system must keep an ex-
plicit model of the user, the system, and the task.
There is a strong relationship between supporting the user interface design 
process and supporting modifiability; this relation is promoted by patterns that 
enforce separation of the user interface from the rest of the system, such as the 
MVC pattern.

Claire Marie Karat has investigated the relation between usability and business 
advantage [Karat 94].
Jakob Nielsen has also written extensively on this topic, including a calcula-
tion on the ROI of usability [Nielsen 08].
Bonnie John and Len Bass have investigated the relation between usabil-
ity and software architecture. They have enumerated around two dozen usability 
scenarios that have architectural impact and given associated patterns for these 
scenarios [Bass 03].
Greg Hartman has defined attentiveness as the ability of the system to sup-
port user initiative and allow cancel or pause/resume [Hartman 10].
Some of the patterns for separating the user interface are Arch/Slinky, See-
heim, and PAC. These are discussed in Chapter 8 of Human-Computer Interac-
tion [Dix 04].

1.	
Write a concrete usability scenario for your automobile that specifies how 
long it takes you to set your favorite radio stations? Now consider another 
part of the driver experience and create scenarios that test other aspects of 
the response measures from the general scenario table.
2.	
Write a concrete usability scenario for an automatic teller machine. How 
would your design be modified to satisfy these scenarios?
