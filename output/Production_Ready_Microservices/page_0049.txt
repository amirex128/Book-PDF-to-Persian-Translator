Evaluate Your Microservice
Now that you have a better understanding of stability and reliability, use the following
list of questions to assess the production-readiness of your microservice(s) and
microservice ecosystem. The questions are organized by topic, and correspond to the
sections within this chapter.
The Development Cycle
• Does the microservice have a central repository where all code is stored?
• Do developers work in a development environment that accurately reflects the
state of production (e.g., that accurately reflects the real world)?
• Are there appropriate lint, unit, integration, and end-to-end tests in place for the
microservice?
• Are there code review procedures and policies in place?
• Is the test, packaging, build, and release process automated?
The Deployment Pipeline
• Does the microservice ecosystem have a standardized deployment pipeline?
• Is there a staging phase in the deployment pipeline that is either full or partial
staging?
• What access does the staging environment have to production services?
• Is there a canary phase in the deployment pipeline?
• Do deployments run in the canary phase for a period of time that is long enough
to catch any failures?
• Does the canary phase accurately host a random sample of production traffic?
• Are the microservice’s ports the same for canary and production?
• Are deployments to production done all at the same time, or incrementally rolled
out?
• Is there a procedure in place for skipping the staging and canary phases in case of
an emergency?
Dependencies
• What are this microservice’s dependencies?
• What are its clients?
