The second thing that happens is a result of simple mathematics: adding new features
to your application increases both the number of lines of code in your application and
the complexity of the application itself.
Third is the necessary horizontal and/or vertical scaling of the application. Increases
in traffic place significant scalability and performance demands on the application,
requiring that more servers host the application. More servers are added, a copy of
the application is deployed to each server, and load balancers are put into place so
that the requests are distributed appropriately among the servers hosting the applica‚Äê
tion (see Figure 1-2, containing a frontend piece, which may contain its own load-
balancing layer, a backend load-balancing layer, and the backend servers). Vertical
scaling becomes a necessity as the application begins processing a larger number of
tasks related to its diverse set of features, so the application is deployed to larger,
more powerful servers that can handle CPU and memory demands (Figure 1-3).
