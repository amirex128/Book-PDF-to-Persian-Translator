qualitative growth scale, which comes from understanding where the service fits into
the overall microservice ecosystem and which key high-level business metrics it will
be affected by. The second is the quantitative growth scale, which is, as its name sug‐
gests, a well-defined, measurable, and quantitative understanding of how much traffic
a microservice can handle.
The Qualitative Growth Scale
The natural tendency when trying to determine the growth scale of a microservice is
to phrase the growth scale in terms of requests per second (RPS) or queries per second
(QPS) that the service can support, then predicting how many RPS/QPS will be made
to the service in the future. The term “requests per second” is generally used when
talking about microservices, and “queries per second” when talking about databases
or microservices that return data to clients, though in many cases they are inter‐
changeable. This is very important information, but it’s useless without additional
context—specifically, without the context of where the microservice fits into the over‐
all picture.
In most cases, information about the RPS/QPS a microservice can support is deter‐
mined by the state of the microservice at the time the growth scale is initially calcula‐
ted: if the growth scale is calculated by only looking at the current levels of traffic and
how the microservice handles the current traffic load, making any inferences about
how much traffic the microservice can handle in the future runs the risk of being
misguided. There are several approaches one could take to get around this problem,
including load testing (testing the microservice with higher loads of traffic), which
can present a more accurate picture of the scalability of the service, and analyzing his‐
torical traffic data to see how the traffic level grows over time. But there’s something
very key missing here, something that is an inherent property of microservice archi‐
tecture—namely, that microservices do not live alone but as part of a larger ecosys‐
tem.
This is where the qualitative growth scale comes in. Qualitative growth scales allow
the scalability of a service to tie in with higher-level business metrics: a microservice
may, for example, scale with the number of users, with the number of people who
open a phone application (“eyeballs”), or with the number of orders (for a food deliv‐
ery service). These metrics, these qualitative growth scales, aren’t tied to an individual
microservice but to the overall system or product(s). At the business level, the organi‐
zation will have, for the most part, some idea of how these metrics will change over
time. When these higher-level business metrics are communicated to engineering
teams, developers can interpret them as they relate to their respective microservices:
if one of their microservices is part of the order flow for a food delivery service, they
will know that any metrics related to the number of orders expected in the future will
tell them what kind of traffic their service should expect.
