easily replaceable, independently developed, and independently deployable. A micro‐
service cannot live alone, however—no microservice is an island—and it is part of a
larger system, running and working alongside other microservices to accomplish
what would normally be handled by one large standalone application.
The goal of microservice architecture is to build a set of small applications that are
each responsible for performing one function (as opposed to the traditional way of
building one application that does everything), and to let each microservice be auton‐
omous, independent, and self-contained. The core difference between a monolithic
application and microservices is this: a monolithic application (Figure 1-4) will con‐
tain all features and functions within one application and one codebase, all deployed
at the same time, with each server hosting a complete copy of the entire application,
while a microservice (Figure 1-5) contains only one function or feature and lives in a
microservice ecosystem along with other microservices that each perform one function
or feature.
