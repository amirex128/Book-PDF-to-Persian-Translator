Knowing the Growth Scale
• What is this microservice’s qualitative growth scale?
• What is this microservice’s quantitative growth scale?
Efficient Use of Resources
• Is the microservice running on dedicated or shared hardware?
• Are any resource abstraction and allocation technologies being used?
Resource Awareness
• What are the microservice’s resource requirements (CPU, RAM, etc.)?
• How much traffic can one instance of the microservice handle?
• How much CPU does one instance of the microservice require?
• How much memory does one instance of the microservice require?
• Are there any other resource requirements that are specific to this microservice?
• What are the resource bottlenecks of this microservice?
• Does this microservice need to be scaled vertically, horizontally, or both?
Capacity Planning
• Is capacity planning performed on a scheduled basis?
• What is the lead time for new hardware?
• How often are hardware requests made?
• Are any microservices given priority when hardware requests are made?
• Is capacity planning automated, or is it manual?
Dependency Scaling
• What are this microservice’s dependencies?
• Are the dependencies scalable and performant?
• Will the dependencies scale with this microservice’s expected growth?
