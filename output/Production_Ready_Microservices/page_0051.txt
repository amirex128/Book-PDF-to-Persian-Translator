CHAPTER 4
Scalability and Performance
A production-ready microservice is scalable and performant. A scalable, performant
microservice is one that is driven by efficiency, one that can not only handle a large
number of tasks or requests at the same time, but can handle them efficiently and is
prepared for tasks or requests to increase in the future. In this chapter, the essential
components of microservice scalability and performance are covered, including
understanding the qualitative and quantitative growth scales, hardware efficiency,
identification of resource requirements and bottlenecks, capacity awareness and plan‐
ning, scalable handling of traffic, the scaling of dependencies, task handling and pro‐
cessing, and scalable data storage.
Principles of Microservice Scalability and Performance
Efficiency is of the utmost importance in real-world, large-scale distributed systems
architecture, and microservice ecosystems are no exception to this rule. It’s easy to
quantify the efficiency of a single system (like a monolithic application), but evaluat‐
ing the efficiency and achieving greater efficiency in a large ecosystem of microservi‐
ces, where tasks are sharded out between hundreds (if not thousands) of small
services, is incredibly difficult. It’s also bounded by the laws of computer architecture
and distributed systems, which place limits on the efficiency of large-scale, complex
distributed systems: the more distributed your system, and the more microservices
you have in place within that system, the less of a difference the efficiency of one
microservice will have on the entire system. Standardization of principles that will
increase overall efficiency becomes a necessity. Two of our production-readiness
standards—scalability and performance—help to achieve this overall efficiency, and
increase the availability of the microservice ecosystem.
Scalability and performance are uniquely intertwined because of the effects they have
on the efficiency of each microservice and the ecosystem as a whole. As we saw in
