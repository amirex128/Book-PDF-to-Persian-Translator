APPENDIX A
Production-Readiness Checklist
This will be a checklist to run over all microservices—manually or in an automated
way.
A Production-Ready Service Is Stable and Reliable
• It has a standardized development cycle.
• Its code is thoroughly tested through lint, unit, integration, and end-to-end
testing.
• Its test, packaging, build, and release process is completely automated.
• It has a standardized deployment pipeline, containing staging, canary, and pro‐
duction phases.
• Its clients are known.
• Its dependencies are known, and there are backups, alternatives, fallbacks, and
caching in place in case of failures.
• It has stable and reliable routing and discovery in place.
A Production-Ready Service Is Scalable and Performant
• Its qualitative and quantitative growth scales are known.
• It uses hardware resources efficiently.
• Its resource bottlenecks and requirements have been identified.
• Capacity planning is automated and performed on a scheduled basis.
• Its dependencies will scale with it.
