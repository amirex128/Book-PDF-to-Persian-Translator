CHAPTER 7
Documentation and Understanding
A production-ready microservice is documented and understood. Documentation
and organizational understanding increase developer velocity while mitigating two of
the most significant trade-offs that come with the adoption of microservice architec‐
ture: organizational sprawl and technical debt. This chapter explores the essential ele‐
ments of documenting and understanding a microservice, including how to build
comprehensive and useful documentation, how to increase microservice understand‐
ing at every level of the microservice ecosystem, and how to implement production-
readiness throughout an engineering organization.
Principles of Microservice Documentation and
Understanding
I’m going to open this final chapter on the last principle of microservice standardiza‐
tion with a famous story from Russian literature. While it may seem rather unortho‐
dox to quote Dostoyevsky in a book on software architecture, the character
Grushenka in The Brothers Karamazov captures so perfectly what I believe to be the
key of microservice documentation and understanding: “Just know one thing,
Rakitka, I may be wicked, but still I gave an onion.”
My favorite part of Dostoyevsky’s brilliant novel is a tale told by the character Grush‐
enka about an old woman and an onion. The tale goes something like this: there was
once an old, bitter woman who was very selfish and heartless. One day, she happened
upon a beggar, and for some reason, felt a great deal of pity. She wanted to give some‐

The old woman eventually died, and thanks to her bitterness and coldness of heart,
ended up in hell. After she had suffered for quite some time, an angel came to save
her, for God had remembered her one selfless deed in life, and wanted to extend the
