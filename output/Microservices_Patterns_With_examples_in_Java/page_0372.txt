.forChannel("accountingService")
.when(AuthorizeCommand.class).replyWithFailure();
else
fail("Don't know what to do with this credit card");
}
This method uses the SagaParticipantStubManager class, a test helper class that con-
figures stubs for saga participants. The useCreditCard() method uses it to configure
the Accounting Service stub to reply with either a success or a failure message,
depending on the specified credit card.
 The following listing shows the placeOrder() method, which defines the When I
place an order for Chicken Vindaloo at Ajanta step. It invokes the Order Service
REST API to create Order and saves the response for validation in a later step.
@ContextConfiguration(classes = 
OrderServiceComponentTestStepDefinitions.TestConfiguration.class)
public class OrderServiceComponentTestStepDefinitions {
private int port = 8082;
private String host = System.getenv("DOCKER_HOST_IP");
protected String baseUrl(String path) {
return String.format("http://%s:%s%s", host, port, path);
}
private Response response;
@When("I place an order for Chicken Vindaloo at Ajanta")
public void placeOrder() {
    response = given().                                               
            body(new CreateOrderRequest(consumerId,
                    RestaurantMother.AJANTA_ID, Collections.singletonList(
                        new CreateOrderRequest.LineItem(
                           RestaurantMother.CHICKEN_VINDALOO_MENU_ITEM_ID,
                          OrderDetailsMother.CHICKEN_VINDALOO_QUANTITY)))).
            contentType("application/json").
            when().
            post(baseUrl("/orders"));
}
The baseUrl() help method returns the URL of the order service.
 Listing 10.15 shows the theOrderShouldBe() method, which defines the meaning
of the Then the order should be … step. It verifies that Order was successfully created
and that it’s in the expected state.
