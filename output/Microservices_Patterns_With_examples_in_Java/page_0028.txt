about the cover illustration
Jefferys
The figure on the cover of Microservices Patterns is captioned “Habit of a Morisco
Slave in 1568.” The illustration is taken from Thomas Jefferys’ A Collection of the Dresses
of Different Nations, Ancient and Modern (four volumes), London, published between
1757 and 1772. The title page states that these are hand-colored copperplate engrav-
ings, heightened with gum arabic. 
 Thomas Jefferys (1719–1771) was called “Geographer to King George III.” He was
an English cartographer who was the leading map supplier of his day. He engraved
and printed maps for government and other official bodies and produced a wide
range of commercial maps and atlases, especially of North America. His work as a map
maker sparked an interest in local dress customs of the lands he surveyed and
mapped, which are brilliantly displayed in this collection. Fascination with faraway
lands and travel for pleasure were relatively new phenomena in the late 18th century,
and collections such as this one were popular, introducing both the tourist as well as
the armchair traveler to the inhabitants of other countries.
 The diversity of the drawings in Jefferys’ volumes speaks vividly of the uniqueness
and individuality of the world’s nations some 200 years ago. Dress codes have changed
since then, and the diversity by region and country, so rich at the time, has faded away.
It’s now often hard to tell the inhabitants of one continent from another. Perhaps, try-
ing to view it optimistically, we’ve traded a cultural and visual diversity for a more var-
ied personal life—or a more varied and interesting intellectual and technical life.
