CHAPTER 12
Deploying microservices
Some languages also let you run multiple services instances in a single process. For
example, as figure 12.5 shows, you can run multiple Java services on a single Apache
Tomcat.
This approach is commonly used when deploying applications on traditional expen-
sive and heavyweight application servers, such as WebLogic and WebSphere. You can
also package services as OSGI bundles and run multiple service instances in each
OSGI container.
 The Service as a language-specific package pattern has both benefits and draw-
backs. Let’s first look at the benefits.
12.1.1 Benefits of the Service as a language-specific package pattern
The Service as a language-specific package pattern has a few benefits:
Fast deployment
Efficient resource utilization, especially when running multiple instances on
the same machine or within the same process
Let’s look at each one.

Deploying multiple service 
instances on the same machine. They 
might be instances of the same service 
or instances of different services. The 
overhead of the OS is shared among the 
service instances. Each service instance 
is a separate process, so there’s some 
isolation between them.

Figure 12.5
Deploying multiple 
services instances on the same web 
container or application server. They 
might be instances of the same service 
or instances of different services. The 
overhead of the OS and runtime is shared 
among all the service instances. But 
because the service instances are in the 
same process, there’s no isolation 
between them.
