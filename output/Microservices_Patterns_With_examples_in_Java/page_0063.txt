Decomposition strategies
Sometimes you have to be careful what you wish for. After an intense lobbying
effort, Mary had finally convinced the business that migrating to a microservice
architecture was the right thing to do. Feeling a mixture of excitement and some
trepidation, Mary had a morning-long meeting with her architects to discuss where
to begin. During the discussion, it became apparent that some aspects of the Micro-
service architecture pattern language, such as deployment and service discovery,
were new and unfamiliar, yet straightforward. The key challenge, which is the
essence of the microservice architecture, is the functional decomposition of the
application into services. The first and most important aspect of the architecture is,
This chapter covers
Understanding software architecture and why it’s 
important
Decomposing an application into services by 
applying the decomposition patterns Decompose 
by business capability and Decompose by 
subdomain
Using the bounded context concept from domain-
driven design (DDD) to untangle data and make 
decomposition easier
