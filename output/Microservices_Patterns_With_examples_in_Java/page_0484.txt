CHAPTER 13
Refactoring to microservices
shows how this works. The login handler returns an additional cookie, which in this
example I call USERINFO, that contains user information, such as the user ID and roles.
The browser includes that cookie in every request. The API gateway extracts the infor-
mation from the cookie and includes it in the HTTP requests that it makes to a ser-
vice. As a result, each service has access to the needed user information.
The sequence of events is as follows:
1
The client makes a login request containing the user’s credentials.
2
API Gateway routes the login request to the FTGO monolith.
3
The monolith returns a response containing the JSESSIONID session cookie
and the USERINFO cookie, which contains the user information, such as ID
and roles.
4
The client makes a request, which includes the USERINFO cookie, in order to
invoke an operation.
5
API Gateway validates the USERINFO cookie and includes it in the Authoriza-
tion header of the request that it makes to the service. The service validates the
USERINFO token and extracts the user information.
Let’s look at LoginHandler and API Gateway in more detail.
THE MONOLITH’S LOGINHANDLER SETS THE USERINFO COOKIE
LoginHandler processes the POST of the user’s credentials. It authenticates the user
and stores information about the user in the session. It’s often implemented by a

The login handler is enhanced to set a USERINFO cookie, which is a JWT containing user 
information. API Gateway transfers the USERINFO cookie to an authorization header when it invokes a 
service.
