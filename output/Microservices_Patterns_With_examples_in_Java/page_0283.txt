External API patterns
The FTGO application, like many other applications, has a REST API. Its clients
include the FTGO mobile applications, JavaScript running in the browser, and
applications developed by partners. In such a monolithic architecture, the API
that’s exposed to clients is the monolith’s API. But when once the FTGO team
starts deploying microservices, there’s no longer one API, because each service has
its own API. Mary and her team must decide what kind of API the FTGO applica-
tion should now expose to its clients. For example, should clients be aware of the
existence of services and make requests to them directly?
This chapter covers
The challenge of designing APIs that support a 
diverse set of clients
Applying API gateway and Backends for frontends 
patterns
Designing and implementing an API gateway
Using reactive programming to simplify API 
composition
Implementing an API gateway using GraphQL
