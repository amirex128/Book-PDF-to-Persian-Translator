The API gateway pattern
API COMPOSITION
An API gateway typically does more than simply reverse proxying. It might also imple-
ment some API operations using API composition. The FTGO API gateway, for exam-
ple, implements the Get Order Details API operation using API composition. As
figure 8.4 shows, the mobile application makes one request to the API gateway, which
fetches the order details from multiple services.
 The FTGO API gateway provides a coarse-grained API that enables mobile clients
to retrieve the data they need with a single request. For example, the mobile client
makes a single getOrderDetails() request to the API gateway.

Figure 8.4
An API gateway often does API composition, which enables a client such as a mobile 
device to efficiently retrieve data using a single API request.
