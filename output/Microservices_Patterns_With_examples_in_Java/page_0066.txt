Decomposition strategies
or deployable units consisting of one or more modules. In Java, a module is a
JAR file, and a component is typically a WAR file or an executable JAR file. The
relations between them include dependency relationships between modules
and composition relationships between components and modules.
Process view—The components at runtime. Each element is a process, and the
relations between processes represent interprocess communication.
Deployment—How the processes are mapped to machines. The elements in this
view consist of (physical or virtual) machines and the processes. The relations
between machines represent networking. This view also describes the relation-
ship between processes and machines.
In addition to these four views, there are the scenarios—the +1 in the 4+1 model—
that animate views. Each scenario describes how the various architectural components
within a particular view collaborate in order to handle a request. A scenario in the log-
ical view, for example, shows how the classes collaborate. Similarly, a scenario in the
process view shows how the processes collaborate.
 The 4+1 view model is an excellent way to describe an applications’s architec-
ture. Each view describes an important aspect of the architecture, and the scenarios

The 4+1 view model describes an application’s architecture using four views, 
along with scenarios that show how the elements within each view collaborate to handle 
requests.
