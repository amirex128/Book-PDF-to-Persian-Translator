Deploying a RESTful service using AWS Lambda and AWS Gateway
tier. The business tier consists of RestaurantService, the Restaurant JPA entity, and
RestaurantRepository, which encapsulates the database.
 Let’s take a look at the FindRestaurantRequestHandler class.
THE FINDRESTAURANTREQUESTHANDLER CLASS
The FindRestaurantRequestHandler class implements the GET /restaurant/
{restaurantId} endpoint. This class along with the other request handler classes are
the leaves of the class hierarchy shown in figure 12.15. The root of the hierarchy is
RequestHandler, which is part of the AWS SDK. Its abstract subclasses handle errors
and inject dependencies.
The AbstractHttpHandler class is the abstract base class for HTTP request handlers.
It catches unhandled exceptions thrown during request handling and returns a 500 -
internal server error response. The AbstractAutowiringHttpRequestHandler class
implements dependency injection for request handlers. I’ll describe these abstract
superclasses shortly, but first let’s look at the code for FindRestaurantRequestHandler.
 Listing 12.9 shows the code for the FindRestaurantRequestHandler class. The
FindRestaurantRequestHandler class has a handleHttpRequest() method, which
takes an APIGatewayProxyRequestEvent representing an HTTP request as a parame-
ter. It invokes RestaurantService to find the restaurant and returns an APIGateway-
ProxyResponseEvent describing the HTTP response.
