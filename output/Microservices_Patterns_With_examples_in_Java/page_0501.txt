Summary
Developing a service often requires you to implement sagas that involve the
monolith. But it can be challenging to implement a compensatable transaction
that requires making widespread changes to the monolith. Consequently, you
sometimes need to carefully sequence the extraction of services to avoid imple-
menting compensatable transactions in the monolith.
When refactoring to a microservice architecture, you need to simultaneously
support the monolithic application’s existing security mechanism, which is often
based on an in-memory session, and the token-based security mechanism used
by the services. Fortunately, a simple solution is to modify the monolith’s login
handler to generate a cookie containing a security token, which is then for-
warded to the services by the API gateway.
