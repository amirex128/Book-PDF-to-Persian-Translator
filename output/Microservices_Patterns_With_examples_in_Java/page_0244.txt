CHAPTER 6
Developing business logic with event sourcing
EXAMPLE EVENT SOURCING-BASED SAGA PARTICIPANT
This example looks at Accounting Service, one of the participants of Create Order
Saga. Figure 6.12 shows how Accounting Service handles the Authorize Command
sent by the saga. Accounting Service is implemented using the Eventuate Saga frame-
work. The Eventuate Saga framework is an open source framework for writing sagas
that use event sourcing. Itâ€™s built on the Eventuate Client framework.
This figure shows how Create Order Saga and AccountingService interact. The
sequence of events is as follows:
AccountCreated
....
AccountAuthorized
AccountAuthorized
