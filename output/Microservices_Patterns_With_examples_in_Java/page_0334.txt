CHAPTER 9
Testing microservices: Part 1
3
The Order Service team publishes the contracts that tested Order Service to a
Maven repository.
4
You use the published contracts to write tests for API Gateway.
Because you test API Gateway using the published contracts, you can be confident that
it works with the deployed Order Service.
 The contracts are the key part of this testing strategy. The following listing shows an
example Spring Cloud Contract. It consists of an HTTP request and an HTTP response.
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
request {
                   
method 'GET'
url '/orders/1223232'
}
response {
       
status 200
headers {
header('Content-Type': 'application/json;charset=UTF-8')
}
body("{ ... }")
}
}

Figure 9.8
The API Gateway team writes the contracts. The Order Service team 
uses those contracts to test Order Service and publishes them to a repository. The 
API Gateway team uses the published contracts to test API Gateway.
