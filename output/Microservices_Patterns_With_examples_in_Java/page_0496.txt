CHAPTER 13
Refactoring to microservices
revises, and cancels a Delivery. A benefit of this approach is that the monolith doesn’t
need to explicitly invoke Delivery Service. The drawback of relying on domain events
is that it requires Delivery Service to know how each Order event impacts the corre-
sponding Delivery.
 A better approach is for Delivery Service to implement a notification-based API
that enables the monolith to explicitly tell Delivery Service to create, revise, and
cancel deliveries. Delivery Service’s API consists of a message notification channel
and three message types: ScheduleDelivery, ReviseDelivery, or CancelDelivery. A
notification message contains Order information needed by Delivery Service. For
example, a ScheduleDelivery notification contains the pickup time and location and
the delivery time and location. An important benefit of this approach is that Delivery
Service doesn’t have detailed knowledge of the Order lifecycle. It’s entirely focused
on managing deliveries and has no knowledge of orders.
 This API isn’t the only way that Delivery Service and the FTGO monolith collab-
orate. They also need to exchange data. 
HOW THE DELIVERY SERVICE ACCESSES THE FTGO MONOLITH’S DATA
Delivery Service needs to access the Courier location and availability data, which is
owned by the monolith. Because that’s potentially a large amount of data, it’s not practi-
cal for the service to repeatedly query the monolith. Instead, a better approach is for the
monolith to replicate the data to Delivery Service by publishing Courier domain
events, CourierLocationUpdated and CourierAvailabilityUpdated. Delivery Service
has a CourierEventSubscriber that subscribes to the domain events and updates its
version of the Courier. It might also trigger the rescheduling of deliveries.

The design of the Delivery Service integration glue. Delivery Service has a delivery 
management API. The service and the FTGO monolith synchronize data by exchanging domain events.
