ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
xxi
 I want to thank my colleagues Andrew, Valentin, Artem, and Stanislav at Eventuate,
Inc., for their contributions to the Eventuate product and open source projects.
 Finally, I’d like to thank my wife, Laura, and my children, Ellie, Thomas, and Janet
for their support and understanding over the last 18 months. While I’ve been glued to
my laptop, I’ve missed out on going to Ellie’s soccer games, watching Thomas learn-
ing to fly on his flight simulator, and trying new restaurants with Janet.
 Thank you all!
