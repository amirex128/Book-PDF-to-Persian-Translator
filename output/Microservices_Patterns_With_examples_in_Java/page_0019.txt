One of my favorite quotes is
The future is already here—it’s just not very evenly distributed.
—William Gibson, science fiction author
The essence of that quote is that new ideas and technology take a while to diffuse
through a community and become widely adopted. A good example of the slow diffu-
sion of ideas is the story of how I discovered microservices. It began in 2006, when,
after being inspired by a talk given by an AWS evangelist, I started down a path that
ultimately led to my creating the original Cloud Foundry. (The only thing in common
with today’s Cloud Foundry is the name.) Cloud Foundry was a Platform-as-a-Service
(PaaS) for automating the deployment of Java applications on EC2. Like every other
enterprise Java application that I’d built, my Cloud Foundry had a monolith architec-
ture consisting of a single Java Web Application Archive (WAR) file.
 Bundling a diverse and complex set of functions such as provisioning, configura-
tion, monitoring, and management into a monolith created both development and
operations challenges. You couldn’t, for example, change the UI without testing and
redeploying the entire application. And because the monitoring and management
component relied on a Complex Event Processing (CEP) engine which maintained
in-memory state we couldn’t run multiple instances of the application! That’s embar-
rassing to admit, but all I can say is that I am a software developer, and, “let he who is
without sin cast the first stone.”
