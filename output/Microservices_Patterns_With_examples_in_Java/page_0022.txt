acknowledgments
Although writing is a solitary activity, it takes a large number of people to turn rough
drafts into a finished book.
 First, I want to thank Erin Twohey and Michael Stevens from Manning for their
persistent encouragement to write another book. I would also like to thank my devel-
opment editors, Cynthia Kane and Marina Michaels. Cynthia Kane got me started and
worked with me on the first few chapters. Marina Michaels took over from Cynthia
and worked with me to the end. I’ll be forever grateful for Marina’s meticulous and
constructive critiques of my chapters. And I want to thank the rest of the Manning
team who’s been involved in getting this book published.
 I’d like to thank my technical development editor, Christian Mennerich, my tech-
nical proofreader, Andy Miles, and all my external reviewers: Andy Kirsch, Antonio
Pessolano, Areg Melik-Adamyan, Cage Slagel, Carlos Curotto, Dror Helper, Eros
Pedrini, Hugo Cruz, Irina Romanenko, Jesse Rosalia, Joe Justesen, John Guthrie,
Keerthi Shetty, Michele Mauro, Paul Grebenc, Pethuru Raj, Potito Coluccelli, Shobha
Iyer, Simeon Leyzerzon, Srihari Sridharan, Tim Moore, Tony Sweets, Trent Whiteley,
Wes Shaddix, William E. Wheeler, and Zoltan Hamori.
 I also want to thank everyone who purchased the MEAP and provided feedback in
the forum or to me directly.
 I want to thank the organizers and attendees of all of the conferences and meetups
at which I’ve spoken for the chance to present and revise my ideas. And I want to
thank my consulting and training clients around the world for giving me the opportu-
nity to help them put my ideas into practice.
