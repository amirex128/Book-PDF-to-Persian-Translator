The verifyEventPublished() method uses the MessageTracker class, a test helper
class that records the events that have been published during the test. This class
and SagaParticipantStubManager are instantiated by the TestConfiguration
@Configuration class.
 Now that we’ve looked at the step definitions, let’s look at how to run the compo-
nent tests. 
RUNNING THE COMPONENT TESTS
Because these tests are relatively slow, we don’t want to run them as part of ./gradlew
test. Instead, we’ll put the test code in a separate src/component-test/java directory
and run them using ./gradlew componentTest. Take a look at the ftgo-order-service/
build.gradle file to see the Gradle configuration.
 The tests use Docker to run Order Service and its dependencies. As described in
chapter 12, a Docker container is a lightweight operating system virtualization
mechanism that lets you deploy a service instance in an isolated sandbox. Docker
Compose is an extremely useful tool with which you can define a set of containers
and start and stop them as a unit. The FTGO application has a docker-compose file
in the root directory that defines containers for all the services, and the infrastruc-
ture service.
 We can use the Gradle Docker Compose plugin to run the containers before exe-
cuting the tests and stop the containers once the tests complete:
apply plugin: 'docker-compose'
dockerCompose.isRequiredBy(componentTest)
componentTest.dependsOn(assemble)
dockerCompose {
startedServices = [ 'ftgo-order-service']
}
The preceding snippet of Gradle configuration does two things. First, it configures
the Gradle Docker Compose plugin to run before the component tests and start
Order Service along with the infrastructure services that it’s configured to depend
on. Second, it configures componentTest to depend on assemble so that the JAR file
required by the Docker image is built first. With that in place, we can run these com-
ponent tests with the following commands:
./gradlew
:ftgo-order-service:componentTest
