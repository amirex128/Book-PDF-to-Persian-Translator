Communicating using the synchronous Remote procedure invocation pattern
OVERVIEW OF SERVICE DISCOVERY
As you’ve just seen, you can’t statically configure a client with the IP addresses of the
services. Instead, an application must use a dynamic service discovery mechanism. Ser-
vice discovery is conceptually quite simple: its key component is a service registry,
which is a database of the network locations of an application’s service instances.
 The service discovery mechanism updates the service registry when service instances
start and stop. When a client invokes a service, the service discovery mechanism que-
ries the service registry to obtain a list of available service instances and routes the
request to one of them.
 There are two main ways to implement service discovery:
The services and their clients interact directly with the service registry.
The deployment infrastructure handles service discovery. (I talk more about
that in chapter 12.)
Let’s look at each option. 
APPLYING THE APPLICATION-LEVEL SERVICE DISCOVERY PATTERNS
One way to implement service discovery is for the application’s services and their cli-
ents to interact with the service registry. Figure 3.5 shows how this works. A service
instance registers its network location with the service registry. A service client invokes
a service by first querying the service registry to obtain a list of service instances. It
then sends a request to one of those instances.
