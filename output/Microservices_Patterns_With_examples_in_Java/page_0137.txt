Using asynchronous messaging to improve availability
4
Order Service sends a ValidateOrderDetails message to Restaurant Service.
5
Consumer Service receives a ValidateConsumerInfo message, verifies the con-
sumer can place an order, and sends a ConsumerValidated message to Order
Service.
6
Restaurant Service receives a ValidateOrderDetails message, verifies the
menu item are valid and that the restaurant can deliver to the order’s delivery
address, and sends an OrderDetailsValidated message to Order Service.
7
Order Service receives ConsumerValidated and OrderDetailsValidated and
changes the state of the order to VALIDATED.

…
Order Service can receive the ConsumerValidated and OrderDetailsValidated mes-
sages in either order. It keeps track of which message it receives first by changing the
state of the order. If it receives the ConsumerValidated first, it changes the state of the
order to CONSUMER_VALIDATED, whereas if it receives the OrderDetailsValidated mes-
sage first, it changes its state to ORDER_DETAILS_VALIDATED. Order Service changes
the state of the Order to VALIDATED when it receives the other message.

Order Service creates an order without invoking any other service. It then asynchronously 
validates the newly created Order by exchanging messages with other services, including Consumer Service 
and Restaurant Service.
