Summary
up a sophisticated deployment infrastructure such as Kubernetes once you’ve
developed some services.
One of the many benefits of using a service mesh—a networking layer that
mediates all network traffic in and out of services—is that it enables you to
deploy a service in production, test it, and only then route production traffic to
it. Separating deployment from release improves the reliability of rolling out
new versions of services.
