Handling the lack of isolation
Retriable transactions—Transactions that follow the pivot transaction and are guar-
anteed to succeed.
In the Create Order Saga, the createOrder(), verifyConsumerDetails(), and create-
Ticket() steps are compensatable transactions. The createOrder() and create-
Ticket() transactions have compensating transactions that undo their updates. The
verifyConsumerDetails() transaction is read-only, so doesn’t need a compensating
transaction. The authorizeCreditCard() transaction is this saga’s pivot transaction. If
the consumer’s credit card can be authorized, this saga is guaranteed to complete. The
approveTicket() and approveOrder() steps are retriable transactions that follow the
pivot transaction.
 The distinction between compensatable transactions and retriable transactions is
especially important. As you’ll see, each type of transaction plays a different role in the
countermeasures. Chapter 13 states that when migrating to microservices, the mono-
lith must sometimes participate in sagas and that it’s significantly simpler if the mono-
lith only ever needs to execute retriable transactions.
 Let’s now look at each countermeasure, starting with the semantic lock counter-
measure.
COUNTERMEASURE: SEMANTIC LOCK
When using the semantic lock countermeasure, a saga’s compensatable transaction
sets a flag in any record that it creates or updates. The flag indicates that the record

Pivot transactions:
The saga’s go/no-go transaction.
If it succeeds, then the saga runs
to completion.
Retriable transactions:
Guaranteed to complete
Figure 4.8
A saga consists of three different types of transactions: compensatable transactions, 
which can be rolled back, so have a compensating transaction, a pivot transaction, which is the 
saga’s go/no-go point, and retriable transactions, which are transactions that don’t need to be 
rolled back and are guaranteed to complete.
