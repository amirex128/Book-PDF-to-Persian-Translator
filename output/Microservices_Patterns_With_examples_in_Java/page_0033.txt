The slow march toward monolithic hell
1.1.1
The architecture of the FTGO application
FTGO is a typical enterprise Java application. Figure 1.1 shows its architecture. The
FTGO application has a hexagonal architecture, which is an architectural style
described in more detail in chapter 2. In a hexagonal architecture, the core of the
application consists of the business logic. Surrounding the business logic are various
adapters that implement UIs and integrate with external systems.
The business logic consists of modules, each of which is a collection of domain
objects. Examples of the modules include Order Management, Delivery Management,
Billing, and Payments. There are several adapters that interface with the external sys-
tems. Some are inbound adapters, which handle requests by invoking the business
logic, including the REST API and Web UI adapters. Others are outbound adapters,
which enable the business logic to access the MySQL database and invoke cloud ser-
vices such as Twilio and Stripe.
 Despite having a logically modular architecture, the FTGO application is packaged
as a single WAR file. The application is an example of the widely used monolithic style
