Breaking apart the monolith: extracting delivery management
Delivery Service and the FTGO monolith to collaborate. But first, let’s look at the
design of Delivery Service’s domain model. 
13.5.3 Designing the Delivery Service domain model
To be able to extract delivery management, we first need to identify the classes that
implement it. Once we’ve done that, we can decide which classes to move to Delivery
Service to form its domain logic. In some cases, we’ll need to split classes. We’ll
also need to decide which data to replicate between the service and the monolith.
 Let’s start by identifying the classes that implement delivery management.
IDENTIFYING WHICH ENTITIES AND THEIR FIELDS ARE PART OF DELIVERY MANAGEMENT
The first step in the process of designing Delivery Service is to carefully review the
delivery management code and identify the participating entities and their fields. Fig-
ure 13.18 shows the entities and fields that are part of delivery management. Some
fields are inputs to the delivery-scheduling algorithm, and others are the outputs. The
figure shows which of those fields are also used by other functionality implemented by
the monolith.
The delivery scheduling algorithm reads various attributes including the Order’s
restaurant, promisedDeliveryTime, and deliveryAddress, and the Courier’s location,
availability, and current plans. It updates the Courier’s plans, the Order’s scheduled-
PickupTime, and scheduledDeliveryTime. As you can see, the fields used by delivery
management are also used by the monolith.

and other functionality implemented by the monolith. A field can be read or written 
or both. It can be accessed by delivery management, the monolith, or both.
