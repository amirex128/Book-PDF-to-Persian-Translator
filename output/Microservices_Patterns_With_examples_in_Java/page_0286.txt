External API patterns

Order Service—Basic order information, including the details and status

Kitchen Service—The status of the order from the restaurant’s perspective
and the estimated time it will be ready for pickup

Delivery Service—The order’s delivery status, its estimated delivery time, and
its current location

Accounting Service—The order’s payment status
If the mobile client invokes the services directly, then it must, as figure 8.2 shows, make
multiple calls to retrieve this data.
