Defining an application’s microservice architecture
A command has a specification that defines its parameters, return value, and behavior
in terms of the domain model classes. The behavior specification consists of precondi-
tions that must be true when the operation is invoked, and post-conditions that are
true after the operation is invoked. Here, for example, is the specification of the
createOrder() system operation:
The preconditions mirror the givens in the Place Order user scenario described ear-
lier. The post-conditions mirror the thens from the scenario. When a system operation
is invoked it will verify the preconditions and perform the actions required to make
the post-conditions true.
 Here’s the specification of the acceptOrder() system operation:
