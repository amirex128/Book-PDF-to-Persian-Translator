CHAPTER 3
Interprocess communication in a microservice architecture
DNS name order-service, which resolves to the virtual IP address 10.1.3.4. The
deployment platform automatically load balances requests across the three instances
of the Order Service.
 This approach is a combination of two patterns:
3rd party registration pattern—Instead of a service registering itself with the ser-
vice registry, a third party called the registrar, which is typically part of the
deployment platform, handles the registration.
Server-side discovery pattern—Instead of a client querying the service registry, it
makes a request to a DNS name, which resolves to a request router that queries
the service registry and load balances requests.

The platform is responsible for service registration, discovery, and request routing. Service 
instances are registered with the service registry by the registrar. Each service has a network location, 
a DNS name/virtual IP address. A client makes a request to the service’s network location. The router 
queries the service registry and load balances requests across the available service instances.
