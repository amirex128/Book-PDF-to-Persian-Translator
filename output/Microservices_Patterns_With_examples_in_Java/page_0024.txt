about this book
The goal of this book is to teach you how to successfully develop applications using
the microservice architecture.
 Not only does it discuss the benefits of the microservice architecture, it also
describes the drawbacks. You’ll learn when you should consider using the monolithic
architecture and when it makes sense to use microservices.
Who should read this book
The focus of this book is on architecture and development. It’s meant for anyone
responsible for developing and delivering software, such as developers, architects,
CTOs, or VPs of engineering.
 The book focuses on explaining the microservice architecture patterns and other
concepts. My goal is for you to find this material accessible, regardless of the technol-
ogy stack you use. You only need to be familiar with the basics of enterprise applica-
tion architecture and design. In particular, you need to understand concepts like
three-tier architecture, web application design, relational databases, interprocess com-
munication using messaging and REST, and the basics of application security. The
code examples, though, use Java and the Spring framework. In order to get the most
out of them, you should be familiar with the Spring framework.
