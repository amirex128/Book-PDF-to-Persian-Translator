Microservice architecture to the rescue

Restaurant Service—Maintains information about restaurants

Kitchen Service—Manages the preparation of orders

Accounting Service—Handles billing and payments
Many services correspond to the modules described earlier in this chapter. What’s dif-
ferent is that each service and its API are very clearly defined. Each one can be inde-
pendently developed, tested, deployed, and scaled. Also, this architecture does a good
job of preserving modularity. A developer can’t bypass a service’s API and access its
internal components. Chapter 13 describes how to transform an existing monolithic
application into microservices. 
1.4.5
Comparing the microservice architecture and SOA
Some critics of the microservice architecture claim it’s nothing new—it’s service-
oriented architecture (SOA). At a very high level, there are some similarities. SOA
and the microservice architecture are architectural styles that structure a system as a
set of services. But as table 1.1 shows, once you dig deep, you encounter significant
differences.
