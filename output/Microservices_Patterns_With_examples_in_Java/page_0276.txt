CHAPTER 7
Implementing queries in a microservice architecture
composite primary key consisting of two scalar attributes. The first attribute is a parti-
tion key. The partition key is so called because DynamoDB’s Z-axis scaling (described in
chapter 1) uses it to select an item’s storage partition. The second attribute is the sort
key. A query() operation returns those items that have the specified partition key,
have a sort key in the specified range, and match the optional filter expression. It
returns items in the order specified by the sort key.
 The findOrderHistory() query operation returns a consumer’s orders sorted by
increasing age. It therefore requires a primary key that has the consumerId as the par-
tition key and the orderCreationDate as the sort key. But it doesn’t make sense for
(consumerId, orderCreationDate) to be the primary key of the ftgo-order-history
table, because it’s not unique.
 The solution is for findOrderHistory() to query what DynamoDB calls a secondary
index on the ftgo-order-history table. This index has (consumerId, orderCreation-
Date) as its non-unique key. Like an RDBMS index, a DynamoDB index is automati-
cally updated whenever its table is updated. But unlike a typical RDBMS index, a
DynamoDB index can have non-key attributes. Non-key attributes improve performance
because they’re returned by the query, so the application doesn’t have to fetch them
from the table. Also, as you’ll soon see, they can be used for filtering. Figure 7.14
shows the structure of the table and this index.
 The index is part of the definition of the ftgo-order-history table and is called
ftgo-order-history-by-consumer-id-and-creation-time. The index’s attributes
