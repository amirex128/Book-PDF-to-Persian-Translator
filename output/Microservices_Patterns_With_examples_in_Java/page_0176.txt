Designing
business logic in
a microservice architecture
The heart of an enterprise application is the business logic, which implements the
business rules. Developing complex business logic is always challenging. The FTGO
application’s business logic implements some quite complex business logic, espe-
cially for order management and delivery management. Mary had encouraged her
team to apply object-oriented design principles, because in her experience this was
the best way to implement complex business logic. Some of the business logic used
the procedural Transcription script pattern. But the majority of the FTGO applica-
tion’s business logic is implemented in an object-oriented domain model that’s
mapped to the database using JPA.
 Developing complex business logic is even more challenging in a microservice
architecture where the business logic is spread over multiple services. You need to
