Developing
production-ready services
Mary and her team felt that they had mastered service decomposition, interservice
communication, transaction management, querying and business logic design, and
testing. They were confident that they could develop services that met their func-
tional requirements. But in order for a service to be ready to be deployed into
production, they needed to ensure that it would also satisfy three critically import-
ant quality attributes: security, configurability, and observability.
This chapter covers:
Developing secure services
Applying the Externalized configuration pattern
Applying the observability patterns:
– Health check API
– Log aggregation
– Distributed tracing
– Exception tracking
– Application metrics
– Audit logging
Simplifying the development of services by 
applying the Microservice chassis pattern
