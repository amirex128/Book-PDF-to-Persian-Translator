PREFACE
xix
 The goal of this book is to answer that question. It will give you a good understand-
ing of the microservice architecture, its benefits and drawbacks, and when to use it.
The book describes how to solve the numerous design challenges you’ll face, includ-
ing how to manage distributed data. It also covers how to refactor a monolithic appli-
cation to a microservice architecture. But this book is not a microservices manifesto.
Instead, it’s organized around a collection of patterns. A pattern is a reusable solution
to a problem that occurs in a particular context. The beauty of a pattern is that
besides describing the benefits of the solution, it also describes the drawbacks and the
issues you must address in order to successfully implement a solution. In my experi-
ence, this kind of objectivity when thinking about solutions leads to much better deci-
sion making. I hope you’ll enjoy reading this book and that it teaches you how to
successfully develop microservices.
