Testing microservices:
Part 2
This chapter builds on the previous chapter, which introduced testing concepts,
including the test pyramid. The test pyramid describes the relative proportions of
the different types of tests that you should write. The previous chapter described
how to write unit tests, which are at the base of the testing pyramid. In this chapter,
we continue our ascent of the testing pyramid.
 This chapter begins with how to write integration tests, which are the level
above unit tests in the testing pyramid. Integration tests verify that a service can prop-
erly interact with infrastructure services, such as databases, and other application
services. Next, I cover component tests, which are acceptance tests for services. A com-
ponent test tests a service in isolation by using stubs for its dependencies. After
that, I describe how to write end-to-end tests, which test a group of services or the
This chapter covers
Techniques for testing services in isolation
Using consumer-driven contract testing to write 
tests that quickly yet reliably verify interservice 
communication
When and how to do end-to-end testing of 
applications
