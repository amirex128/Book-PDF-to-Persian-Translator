Querying using the API composition pattern
query operation by invoking the services that own the data and combining the results.
Figure 7.2 shows the structure of this pattern. It has two types of participants:
An API composer—This implements the query operation by querying the pro-
vider services.
A provider service—This is a service that owns some of the data that the query
returns.
Figure 7.2 shows three provider services. The API composer implements the query by
retrieving data from the provider services and combining the results. An API com-
poser might be a client, such as a web application, that needs the data to render a web
page. Alternatively, it might be a service, such as an API gateway and its Backends for
frontends variant described in chapter 8, which exposes the query operation as an API
endpoint.
Whether you can use this pattern to implement a particular query operation depends
on several factors, including how the data is partitioned, the capabilities of the APIs
exposed by the services that own the data, and the capabilities of the databases used
by the services. For instance, even if the Provider services have APIs for retrieving the

The API composition pattern consists of an API composer and two or more provider 
services. The API composer implements a query by querying the providers and combining the results.
