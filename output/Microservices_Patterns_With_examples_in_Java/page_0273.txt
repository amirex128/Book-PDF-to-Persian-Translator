Implementing a CQRS view with AWS DynamoDB

OrderHistoryDataAccess—Contains the OrderHistoryDAO, which defines the
methods that update and query the ftgo-order-history DynamoDB table and
its helper classes

ftgo-order-history DynamoDB table—The table that stores the orders
Let’s look at the design of the event handlers, the DAO, and the DynamoDB table in
more detail.
7.4.1
The OrderHistoryEventHandlers module
This module consists of the event handlers that consume events and update the
DynamoDB table. As the following listing shows, the event handlers are simple meth-
ods. Each method is a one-liner that invokes an OrderHistoryDao method with argu-
ments that are derived from the event.

The design of OrderHistoryService. OrderHistory-
EventHandlers updates the database in response to events. The 
OrderHistoryQuery module implements the query operations by query-
ing the database. These two modules use the OrderHistory-
DataAccess module to access the database.
