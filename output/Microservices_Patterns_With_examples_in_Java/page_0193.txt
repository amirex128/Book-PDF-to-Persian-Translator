Publishing domain events
 Event storming consist of three main steps:
1
Brainstorm events—Ask the domain experts to brainstorm the domain events.
Domain events are represented by orange sticky notes that are laid out in a
rough timeline on the modeling surface.
2
Identify event triggers—Ask the domain experts to identify the trigger of each
event, which is one of the following:
– User actions, represented as a command using a blue sticky note
– External system, represented by a purple sticky note
– Another domain event
– Passing of time
3
Identify aggregates—Ask the domain experts to identify the aggregate that con-
sumes each command and emits the corresponding event. Aggregates are rep-
resented by yellow sticky notes.
Figure 5.10 shows the result of an event-storming workshop. In just a couple of hours,
the participants identified numerous domain events, commands, and aggregates. It
was a good first step in the process of creating a domain model.
Event storming is a useful technique for quickly creating a domain model.
 Now that we’ve covered the basics of domain events, let’s look at the mechanics of
generating and publishing them.

The result of an event-storming workshop that lasted a couple of hours. The sticky notes 
are events, which are laid out along a timeline; commands, which represent user actions; and 
aggregates, which emit events in response to a command.
