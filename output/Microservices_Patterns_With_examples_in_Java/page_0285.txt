External API design issues
To learn more about these drawbacks, let’s take a look at how the FTGO mobile appli-
cation for consumers retrieves data from the services.
8.1.1
API design issues for the FTGO mobile client
Consumers use the FTGO mobile client to place and manage their orders. Imagine
you’re developing the mobile client’s View Order view, which displays an order. As
described in chapter 7, the information displayed by this view includes basic order
information, including its status, payment status, status of the order from the restau-
rant’s perspective, and delivery status, including its location and estimated delivery
time if in transit.
 The monolithic version of the FTGO application has an API endpoint that returns
the order details. The mobile client retrieves the information it needs by making a sin-
gle request. In contrast, in the microservices version of the FTGO application, the
order details are, as described previously, scattered across several services, including
the following:
Lower-performance

Higher-performance

Backend services
Order Service

Figure 8.1
The FTGO application’s services and their clients. There are several 
different types of clients. Some are inside the firewall, and others are outside. 
Those outside the firewall access the services over the lower-performance 
internet/mobile network. Those clients inside the firewall use a higher-
performance LAN.
