CHAPTER 9
Testing microservices: Part 1
Other services interact through request/asynchronous reply or publish/subscribe
using asynchronous messaging. For instance, figure 9.6 shows how some of the ser-
vices in the FTGO application communicate. Each arrow points from a consumer ser-
vice to a producer service.
The arrow points in the direction of the dependency, from the consumer of the API
to the provider of the API. The assumptions that a consumer makes about an API
depend on the nature of the interaction:
REST client  service—The API gateway routes requests to services and imple-
ments API composition.
Domain event consumer  publisher—Order History Service consumes events pub-
lished by Order Service.
Command message requestor  replier—Order Service sends command messages
to various services and consumes the replies.
