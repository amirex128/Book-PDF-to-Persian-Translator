Developing secure services
One key part of the security architecture is the session, which stores the principal’s ID
and roles. The FTGO application is a traditional Java EE application, so the session is
an HttpSession in-memory session. A session is identified by a session token, which the
client includes in each request. It’s usually an opaque token such as a cryptographi-
cally strong random number. The FTGO application’s session token is an HTTP
cookie called JSESSIONID.
 The other key part of the security implementation is the security context, which
stores information about the user making the current request. The Spring Security
Using a security framework
Implementing authentication and authorization correctly is challenging. It’s best to
use a proven security framework. Which framework to use depends on your applica-
tion’s technology stack. Some popular frameworks include the following:
Spring Security (https://projects.spring.io/spring-security/)—A popular frame-
work for Java applications. It’s a sophisticated framework that handles authen-
tication and authorization.
Apache Shiro (https://shiro.apache.org)—Another Java framework.
Passport (http://www.passportjs.org)—A popular security framework for NodeJS
applications that’s focused on authentication.

token, which is a cookie.
Include session token cookie,
which identiﬁes the user, in
subsequent requests.

A client of the FTGO application first logs in to obtain a session token, which is often a 
cookie. The client includes the session token in each subsequent request it makes to the application.
