@EnableAutoConfiguration
@Import({EventuateContractVerifierConfiguration.class,

public static class TestConfiguration {
@Bean
public OrderDomainEventPublisher
OrderDomainEventPublisher(DomainEventPublisher eventPublisher) {
return new OrderDomainEventPublisher(eventPublisher);
}
}
@Autowired
private OrderDomainEventPublisher OrderDomainEventPublisher;
protected void orderCreated() {
    
OrderDomainEventPublisher.publish(CHICKEN_VINDALOO_ORDER,
singletonList(new OrderCreatedEvent(CHICKEN_VINDALOO_ORDER_DETAILS)
));
}
}
This test class configures OrderDomainEventPublisher with in-memory messaging
stubs. orderCreated() is invoked by the test method generated from the contract
shown earlier in listing 10.5. It invokes OrderDomainEventPublisher to publish an
OrderCreated event. The test method attempts to receive this event and then verifies
that it matches the event specified in the contract. Letâ€™s now look at the correspond-
ing consumer-side tests. 
CONSUMER-SIDE CONTRACT TEST FOR THE ORDER HISTORY SERVICE
Order History Service consumes events published by Order Service. As I described
in chapter 7, the adapter class that handles these events is the OrderHistoryEvent-
Handlers class. Its event handlers invoke OrderHistoryDao to update the CQRS view.
Listing 10.7 shows the consumer-side integration test. It creates an OrderHistoryEvent-
Handlers injected with a mock OrderHistoryDao. Each test method first invokes Spring
Cloud to publish the event defined in the contract and then verifies that OrderHistory-
EventHandlers invokes OrderHistoryDao correctly.
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes= OrderHistoryEventHandlersTest.TestConfiguration.class,
webEnvironment= SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.NONE)
@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids =
{"net.chrisrichardson.ftgo.contracts:ftgo-order-service-contracts"},
workOffline = false)
Listing 10.7
The consumer-side integration test for the OrderHistoryEventHandlers 
class
orderCreated() is invoked by a
code-generated test subclass
to publish the event.
