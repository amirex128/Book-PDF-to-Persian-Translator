DEPLOYING VERSION 2 OF CONSUMER SERVICE
Here’s an excerpt of the version 2 Deployment for Consumer Service:
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
name: ftgo-consumer-service-v2
  
spec:
replicas: 1
template:
metadata:
labels:
app: ftgo-consumer-service
version: v2
  
...
This deployment is called ftgo-consumer-service-v2. It labels its pods with version:
v2. After creating this deployment, both versions of the ftgo-consumer-service will be
running. But because of the routing rules, Istio won’t route any traffic to v2. You’re
now ready to route some test traffic to v2. 
ROUTING TEST TRAFFIC TO VERSION 2
Once you’ve deployed a new version of a service, the next step is to test it. Let’s sup-
pose that requests from test users have a testuser header . We can enhance the ftgo-
consumer-service VirtualService to route requests with this header to v2 instances
by making the following change:
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
name: ftgo-consumer-service
spec:
hosts:
- ftgo-consumer-service
http:
- match:
- headers:
testuser:
regex: "^.+$"
  
route:
- destination:
host: ftgo-consumer-service
subset: v2
  
- route:
- destination:
host: ftgo-consumer-service
subset: v1
  
In addition to the original default route, VirtualService has a routing rule that
routes requests with the testuser header to the v2 subset. After you’ve updated the
rules, you can now test Consumer Service. Then, once you feel confident that the v2 is
working, you can route some production traffic to it. Let’s look at how to do that. 
Version 2
Pod is labeled 
with the version
Matches a nonblank 
testuser header
Routes test 
users to v2
Routes everyone 
else to v1
