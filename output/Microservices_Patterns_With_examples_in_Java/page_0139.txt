patterns. It’s more work, but it does handle the scenario where services are run-
ning on multiple deployment platforms.
A good way to design a messaging-based architecture is to use the messages and
channels model, which abstracts the details of the underlying messaging system.
You can then map that design to a specific messaging infrastructure, which is
typically message broker–based.
One key challenge when using messaging is atomically updating the database
and publishing a message. A good solution is to use the Transactional outbox
pattern and first write the message to the database as part of the database trans-
action. A separate process then retrieves the message from the database using
either the Polling publisher pattern or the Transaction log tailing pattern and
publishes it to the message broker.
