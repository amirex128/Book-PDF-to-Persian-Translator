What is the microservice architecture exactly?
Surrounding the business logic are adapters. As with ports, there are two types of
adapters: inbound and outbound. An inbound adapter handles requests from the out-
side world by invoking an inbound port. An example of an inbound adapter is a
Spring MVC Controller that implements either a set of REST endpoints or a set of
web pages. Another example is a message broker client that subscribes to messages.
Multiple inbound adapters can invoke the same inbound port.
 An outbound adapter implements an outbound port and handles requests from
the business logic by invoking an external application or service. An example of an
outbound adapter is a data access object (DAO) class that implements operations for
accessing a database. Another example would be a proxy class that invokes a remote
service. Outbound adapters can also publish events.
 An important benefit of the hexagonal architectural style is that it decouples the
business logic from the presentation and data access logic in the adapters. The busi-
ness logic doesnâ€™t depend on either the presentation logic or the data access logic.

Figure 2.2
An example of a hexagonal architecture, which consists of the business logic and one or 
more adapters that communicate with external systems. The business logic has one or more ports. 
Inbound adapters, which handled requests from external systems, invoke an inbound port. An 
outbound adapter implements an outbound port, and invokes an external system.
