Developing secure services
The sequence of events for API clients is as follows:
1
A client makes a request containing credentials.
2
The API gateway authenticates the credentials, creates a security token, and
passes that to the service or services.
The sequence of events for login-based clients is as follows:
1
A client makes a login request containing credentials.
2
The API gateway returns a security token.
3
The client includes the security token in requests that invoke operations.
4
The API gateway validates the security token and forwards it to the service or
services.
A little later in this chapter, I describe how to implement tokens, but let’s first look at
the other main aspect of security: authorization. 
Order
Service
API clients supply credentials
in the Authorization header.
Pass token to services so
that they can identify and
authorize the user.
Include the security token
in each request.
Login clients ﬁrst obtain
a security token.

Figure 11.3
The API gateway authenticates requests from clients and includes a security token in the requests 
it makes to services. The services use the token to obtain information about the principal. The API gateway can 
also use the security token as a session token.
