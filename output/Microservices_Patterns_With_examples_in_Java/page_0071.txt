What is the microservice architecture exactly?
A key constraint imposed by the microservice architecture is that the services are
loosely coupled. Consequently, there are restrictions on how the services collaborate.
In order to explain those restrictions, I’ll attempt to define the term service, describe
what it means to be loosely coupled, and tell you why this matters.
WHAT IS A SERVICE?
A service is a standalone, independently deployable software component that imple-
ments some useful functionality. Figure 2.4 shows the external view of a service, which in
this example is the Order Service. A service has an API that provides its clients access to
its functionality. There are two types of operations: commands and queries. The API
consists of commands, queries, and events. A command, such as createOrder(), per-
forms actions and updates data. A query, such as findOrderById(), retrieves data. A ser-
vice also publishes events, such as OrderCreated, which are consumed by its clients.
 A service’s API encapsulates its internal implementation. Unlike in a monolith, a
developer can’t write code that bypasses its API. As a result, the microservice architec-
ture enforces the application’s modularity.
 Each service in a microservice architecture has its own architecture and, potentially,
technology stack. But a typical service has a hexagonal architecture. Its API is imple-
mented by adapters that interact with the service’s business logic. The operations
