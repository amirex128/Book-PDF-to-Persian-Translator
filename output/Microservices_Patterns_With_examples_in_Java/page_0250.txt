Implementing queries in a
microservice architecture
Mary and her team were just starting to get comfortable with the idea of using sagas
to maintain data consistency. Then they discovered that transaction management
wasn’t the only distributed data-related challenge they had to worry about when
migrating the FTGO application to microservices. They also had to figure out how
to implement queries.
 In order to support the UI, the FTGO application implements a variety of
query operations. Implementing these queries in the existing monolithic applica-
tion is relatively straightforward, because it has a single database. For the most
part, all the FTGO developers needed to do was write SQL SELECT statements
and define the necessary indexes. As Mary discovered, writing queries in a micro-
service architecture is challenging. Queries often need to retrieve data that’s scattered
