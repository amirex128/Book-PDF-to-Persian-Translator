Managing transactions
with sagas
When Mary started investigating the microservice architecture, one of her biggest
concerns was how to implement transactions that span multiple services. Transac-
tions are an essential ingredient of every enterprise application. Without transac-
tions it would be impossible to maintain data consistency.
 ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions greatly simplify
the job of the developer by providing the illusion that each transaction has exclu-
sive access to the data. In a microservice architecture, transactions that are within a
single service can still use ACID transactions. The challenge, however, lies in imple-
menting transactions for operations that update data owned by multiple services.
This chapter covers
Why distributed transactions aren’t a good fit for 
modern applications
Using the Saga pattern to maintain data 
consistency in a microservice architecture
Coordinating sagas using choreography and 
orchestration
Using countermeasures to deal with the lack of 
isolation
