Developing business logic with event sourcing
create table events (
event_id varchar(1000) PRIMARY KEY,
event_type varchar(1000),
event_data varchar(1000) NOT NULL,
entity_type VARCHAR(1000) NOT NULL,
entity_id VARCHAR(1000) NOT NULL,
triggering_event VARCHAR(1000)
);
The triggering_event column is used to detect duplicate events/messages. It stores
the ID of the message/event whose processing generated this event.
 The entities table stores the current version of each entity. It’s used to imple-
ment optimistic locking. Here’s the definition of this table:
create table entities (
entity_type VARCHAR(1000),
entity_id VARCHAR(1000),
entity_version VARCHAR(1000) NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY(entity_type, entity_id)
);
When an entity is created, a row is inserted into this table. Each time an entity is
updated, the entity_version column is updated.
 The snapshots table stores the snapshots of each entity. Here’s the definition of
this table:
create table snapshots (
entity_type VARCHAR(1000),
entity_id VARCHAR(1000),
entity_version VARCHAR(1000),
snapshot_type VARCHAR(1000) NOT NULL,
snapshot_json VARCHAR(1000) NOT NULL,
triggering_events VARCHAR(1000),
PRIMARY KEY(entity_type, entity_id, entity_version)
)
The entity_type and entity_id columns specify the snapshot’s entity. The snapshot
_json column is the serialized representation of the snapshot, and the snapshot_type
is its type. The entity_version specifies the version of the entity that this is a snap-
shot of.
 The three operations supported by this schema are find(), create(), and
update(). The find() operation queries the snapshots table to retrieve the latest
snapshot, if any. If a snapshot exists, the find() operation queries the events table to
find all events whose event_id is greater than the snapshot’s entity_version. Other-
wise, find() retrieves all events for the specified entity. The find() operation also
queries the entity table to retrieve the entity’s current version.
 The create() operation inserts a row into the entity table and inserts the events
into the events table. The update() operation inserts events into the events table. It
