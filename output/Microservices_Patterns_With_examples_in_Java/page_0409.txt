Developing services using the Microservice chassis pattern
A much faster way to develop services is to build your services upon a microservices
chassis. As figure 11.16 shows, a microservice chassis is a framework or set of frameworks
that handle these concerns. When using a microservice chassis, you write little, if any,
code to handle these concerns.
In this section, I first describe the concept of a microservice chassis and suggest some
excellent microservice chassis frameworks. After that I introduce the concept of a ser-
vice mesh, which at the time of writing is emerging as an intriguing alternative to
using frameworks and libraries.
 Let’s first look at the idea of a microservice chassis.
11.4.1 Using a microservice chassis
A microservices chassis is a framework or set of frameworks that handle numerous
concerns including the following:
Externalized configuration
Health checks
Application metrics
Service discovery
Pattern: Microservice chassis
Build services on a framework or collection of frameworks that handle cross-cutting
concerns, such as exception tracking, logging, health checks, externalized configu-
ration, and distributed tracing. See http://microservices.io/patterns/microservice-
chassis.html.
