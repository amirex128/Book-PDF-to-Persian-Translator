External API patterns
and rate limiting. Figure 8.3 shows the relationship between the clients, the API gate-
way, and the services.
The API gateway is responsible for request routing, API composition, and protocol
translation. All API requests from external clients first go to the API gateway, which
routes some requests to the appropriate service. The API gateway handles other
requests using the API composition pattern and by invoking multiple services and
aggregating the results. It may also translate between client-friendly protocols such as
HTTP and WebSockets and client-unfriendly protocols used by the services.
REQUEST ROUTING
One of the key functions of an API gateway is request routing. An API gateway imple-
ments some API operations by routing requests to the corresponding service. When it
receives a request, the API gateway consults a routing map that specifies which service
to route the request to. A routing map might, for example, map an HTTP method
and path to the HTTP URL of a service. This function is identical to the reverse proxy-
ing features provided by web servers such as NGINX.
