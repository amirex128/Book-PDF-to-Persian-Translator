Strategies for refactoring a monolith to microservices
 A great way to delay and possibly avoid making these kinds of expensive changes is
to use an approach that’s similar to the one described in Refactoring Databases. A major
obstacle to refactoring a database is changing all the clients of that database to use the
new schema. The solution proposed in the book is to preserve the original schema for
a transition period and use triggers to synchronize the original and new schemas. You
then migrate clients from the old schema to the new schema over time.
 We can use a similar approach when extracting services from the monolith. For
example, when extracting the Delivery entity, we leave the Order entity mostly
unchanged for a transition period. As figure 13.7 shows, we make the delivery-related
fields read-only and keep them up-to-date by replicating data from Delivery Service
back to the monolith. As a result, we only need to find the places in the monolith’s code
that update those fields and change them to invoke the new Delivery Service.
 Preserving the structure of the Order entity by replicating data from Delivery
Service significantly reduces the amount of work we need to do immediately. Over
time, we can migrate code that uses the delivery-related Order entity fields or ORDERS
table columns to Delivery Service. What’s more, it’s possible that we never need to

newly extracted Delivery Service back to the monolith’s database.
