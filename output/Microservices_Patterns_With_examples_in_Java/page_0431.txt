Deploying the FTGO application with Kubernetes
Scheduler—Selects a node to run a pod.
Controller manager—Runs the controllers, which ensure that the state of the clus-
ter matches the intended state. For example, one type of controller known as a
replication controller ensures that the desired number of instances of a service
are running by starting and terminating instances.
A node runs several components, including the following:
Kubelet—Creates and manages the pods running on the node
Kube-proxy—Manages networking, including load balancing across pods
Pods—The application services

A Kubernetes cluster consists of a master, which manages the cluster, and nodes, 
which run the services. Developers and the deployment pipeline interact with Kubernetes through the 
API server, which along with other cluster-management software runs on the master. Application 
containers run on nodes. Each node runs a Kubelet, which manages the application container, and a 
kube-proxy, which routes application requests to the pods, either directly as a proxy or indirectly by 
configuring iptables routing rules built into the Linux kernel.
