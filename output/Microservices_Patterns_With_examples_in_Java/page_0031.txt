Escaping monolithic hell
It was only Monday lunchtime, but Mary, the CTO of Food to Go, Inc. (FTGO), was
already feeling frustrated. Her day had started off really well. She had spent the
previous week with other software architects and developers at an excellent confer-
ence learning about the latest software development techniques, including contin-
uous deployment and the microservice architecture. Mary had also met up with her
former computer science classmates from North Carolina A&T State and shared
technology leadership war stories. The conference had left her feeling empowered
and eager to improve how FTGO develops software.
