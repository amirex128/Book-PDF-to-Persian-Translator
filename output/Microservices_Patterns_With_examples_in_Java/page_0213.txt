Developing business
logic with event sourcing
Mary liked the idea, described in chapter 5, of structuring business logic as a collec-
tion of DDD aggregates that publish domain events. She could imagine the use of
those events being extremely useful in a microservice architecture. Mary planned
to use events to implement choreography-based sagas, which maintain data consis-
tency across services and are described in chapter 4. She also expected to use CQRS
views, replicas that support efficient querying that are described in chapter 7.
 She was, however, worried that the event publishing logic might be error prone.
On one hand, the event publishing logic is reasonably straightforward. Each of an
aggregate’s methods that initializes or changes the state of the aggregate returns a
list of events. The domain service then publishes those events. But on the other
