Defining an applicationâ€™s microservice architecture
the Place Order story. We can expand that story into numerous user scenarios includ-
ing this one:
Given a consumer
And a restaurant
And a delivery address/time that can be served by that restaurant
And an order total that meets the restaurant's order minimum
When the consumer places an order for the restaurant
Then consumer's credit card is authorized
And an order is created in the PENDING_ACCEPTANCE state
And the order is associated with the consumer
And the order is associated with the restaurant
The nouns in this user scenario hint at the existence of various classes, including
Consumer, Order, Restaurant, and CreditCard.
 Similarly, the Accept Order story can be expanded into a scenario such as this one:
Given an order that is in the PENDING_ACCEPTANCE state
and a courier that is available to deliver the order
When a restaurant accepts an order with a promise to prepare by a particular
time
Then the state of the order is changed to ACCEPTED
And the order's promiseByTime is updated to the promised time
And the courier is assigned to deliver the order
This scenario suggests the existence of Courier and Delivery classes. The end result
after a few iterations of analysis will be a domain model that consists, unsurprisingly,
of those classes and others, such as MenuItem and Address. Figure 2.7 is a class dia-
gram that shows the key classes.
