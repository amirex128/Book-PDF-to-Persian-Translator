INTEGRATING THE APOLLO GRAPHQL SERVER WITH EXPRESS
The Apollo GraphQL server executes GraphQL queries. In order for clients to invoke
it, you need to integrate it with a web framework. Apollo GraphQL server supports
several web frameworks, including Express, a popular NodeJS web framework.
 Listing 8.10 shows how to use the Apollo GraphQL server in an Express applica-
tion. The key function is graphqlExpress, which is provided by the apollo-server-
express module. It builds an Express request handler that executes GraphQL queries
against a schema. This example configures Express to route requests to the GET
/graphql and POST /graphql endpoints of this GraphQL request handler. It also creates
a GraphQL context containing the proxies, which makes them available to the resolvers.
const {graphqlExpress} = require("apollo-server-express");
const typeDefs = gql`
   
type Query {
orders: resolveOrders,
...
}
type Consumer {
...
const resolvers = {     
Query: {
...
}
}
const schema = makeExecutableSchema({ typeDefs, resolvers });    
const app = express();
function makeContextWithDependencies(req) {      
const orderServiceProxy = new OrderServiceProxy();
const consumerServiceProxy = new ConsumerServiceProxy();
const restaurantServiceProxy = new RestaurantServiceProxy();
...
return {orderServiceProxy, consumerServiceProxy,
restaurantServiceProxy, ...};
}
function makeGraphQLHandler() {
   
return graphqlExpress(req => {
return {schema: schema, context: makeContextWithDependencies(req)}
});
}
app.post('/graphql', bodyParser.json(), makeGraphQLHandler());
  
app.get('/graphql', makeGraphQLHandler());
app.listen(PORT);
Listing 8.10
Integrating the GraphQL server with the Express web framework
Define the GraphQL 
schema.
Define the 
resolvers.
Combine the 
schema with the 
resolvers to create 
an executable 
schema.
Inject repositories into 
the context so theyâ€™re 
available to resolvers.
Make an express request handler 
that executes GraphQL queries 
against the executable schema.
Route POST /graphql and GET
/graphql endpoints to the
GraphQL server.
