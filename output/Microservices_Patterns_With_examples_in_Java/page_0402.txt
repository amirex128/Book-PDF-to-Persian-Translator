CHAPTER 11
Developing production-ready services
The [ftgo-order-service,8d8fdc37be104cc6,8d8fdc37be104cc6,false] part of the
log entry (the SLF4J Mapped Diagnostic Context—see www.slf4j.org/manual.html)
contains information from the distributed tracing infrastructure. It consists of four
values:

ftgo-order-service—The name of the application

8d8fdc37be104cc6—The traceId

8d8fdc37be104cc6—The spanId

false—Indicates that this span wasn’t exported to the distributed tracing server
If you search the logs for 8d8fdc37be104cc6, you’ll find all log entries for that request.
 Figure 11.13 shows how distributed tracing works. There are two parts to distrib-
uted tracing: an instrumentation library, which is used by each service, and a distributed
tracing server. The instrumentation library manages the traces and spans. It also adds

Each service (including the API gateway) uses an instrumentation library. The 
instrumentation library assigns an ID to each external request, propagates tracing state between 
services, and reports spans to the distributed tracing server.
