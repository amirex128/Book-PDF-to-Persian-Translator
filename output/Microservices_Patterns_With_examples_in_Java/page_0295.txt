The API gateway pattern
The solution is to have an API gateway for each client, the so-called Backends for front-
ends (BFF) pattern, which was pioneered by Phil Calçado (http://philcalcado.com/)
and his colleagues at SoundCloud. As figure 8.7 shows, each API module becomes its
own standalone API gateway that’s developed and operated by a single client team.
Pattern: Backends for frontends
Implement a separate API gateway for each type of client. See http://microservices
.io/patterns/apigateway.html.

A client team owns their API module. As they change the client, they can change the API 
module and not ask the API gateway team to make the changes.
