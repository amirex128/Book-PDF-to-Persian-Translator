CHAPTER 10
Testing microservices: Part 2
In both scenarios, a consumer attempts to place an order. In the first scenario, they
succeed. In the second scenario, the order is rejected because the consumer’s credit
card has expired. For more information on Gherkin, see the book Writing Great Specifi-
cations: Using Specification by Example and Gherkin by Kamil Nicieja (Manning, 2017).
EXECUTING GHERKIN SPECIFICATIONS USING CUCUMBER
Cucumber is an automated testing framework that executes tests written in Gherkin.
It’s available in a variety of languages, including Java. When using Cucumber for Java,
you write a step definition class, such as the one shown in listing 10.12. A step definition
class consists of methods that define the meaning of each given-then-when step. Each
step definition method is annotated with either @Given, @When, @Then, or @And. Each
of these annotations has a value element that’s a regular expression, which Cucum-
ber matches against the steps.
public class StepDefinitions ...
{
...
@Given("A valid consumer")
public void useConsumer() { ... }
@Given("using a(.?) (.*) credit card")
public void useCreditCard(String ignore, String creditCard) { ... }
@When("I place an order for Chicken Vindaloo at Ajanta")
public void placeOrder() { ... }
@Then("the order should be (.*)")
public void theOrderShouldBe(String desiredOrderState) { ... }
@And("an (.*) event should be published")
public void verifyEventPublished(String expectedEventClass)
{ ... }
}
Each type of method is part of a particular phase of the test:

@Given—The setup phase

@When—The execute phase

@Then and @And—The verification phase
Later in section 10.2.4, when I describe this class in more detail, you’ll see that many
of these methods make REST calls to Order Service. For example, the placeOrder()
method creates Order by invoking the POST /orders REST endpoint. The the-
OrderShouldBe() method verifies the status of the order by invoking GET /orders/
{orderId}.
 But before getting into the details of how to write step classes, let’s explore some
design issues with component tests. 
Listing 10.12
The Java step definitions class makes the Gherkin scenarios executable.
