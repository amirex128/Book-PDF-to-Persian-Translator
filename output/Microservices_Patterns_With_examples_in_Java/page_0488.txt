Refactoring to microservices
endpoint for querying the customer contact information. Delivery Service calls this
endpoint when it needs to notify a user that their order cannot be delivered on time.
Let’s look at the design of each part of the integration, starting with the REST API for
retrieving customer contact information.
QUERYING CUSTOMER CONTACT INFORMATION USING CUSTOMERCONTACTINFOREPOSITORY
As described in section 13.3.1, there are a couple of different ways that a service such
as Delayed Delivery Service could read the monolith’s data. The simplest option is
for Delayed Order Service to retrieve data using the monolith’s query API. This
approach makes sense when retrieving the User contact information. There aren’t
any latency or performance, issues because Delayed Delivery Service rarely needs to
retrieve a user’s contact information, and the amount of data is quite small.
 CustomerContactInfoRepository is an interface that enables Delayed Delivery
Service to retrieve a consumer’s contact info. It’s implemented by a Customer-
ContactInfoProxy, which retrieves the user information by invoking the monolith’s
getCustomerContactInfo() REST endpoint. 
PUBLISHING AND CONSUMING ORDER AND RESTAURANT DOMAIN EVENTS
Unfortunately, it isn’t practical for Delayed Delivery Service to query the mono-
lith for the state of all open Orders and Restaurant hours. That’s because it’s ineffi-
cient to repeatedly transfer a large amount of data over the network. Consequently,
Delayed Delivery Service must use the second, more complex option and main-
tain a replica of Orders and Restaurants by subscribing to events published by the
monolith. It’s important to remember that the replica isn’t a complete copy of the
data from the monolith—it just stores a small subset of the attributes of Order and
Restaurant entities.

The integration glue provides Delayed Delivery Service with access to the data owned by 
the monolith.
