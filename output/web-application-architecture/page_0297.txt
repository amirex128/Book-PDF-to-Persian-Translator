11.7. Process modelling
We started this chapter with a discussion about framework-inspired archi-
tecture. Frameworks propose a number of elements that should be used to
build your application: controllers, models, templates, etc. In the previous
sections we discussed an alternative set of elements that can also be used
to build your application: entities, repositories, application services, events,
event subscribers, read models, and view models. The difference of course
is that when using elements like application services and entities as building
blocks, your design doesn’t depend on a framework nor on any other piece
of infrastructure.
This new set of elements clearly describes the use cases of your application:
what you can do with it, what the consequences are, and which information
the application exposes, without talking about implementation details. Being
able to leave out implementation details is a sign that we can use these ele-
ments in high-level modelling sessions. You’ll find this modelling technique
