14. A testing strategy for decoupled applications
Feature: Ordering an e-book
Scenario: the customer receives an order confirmation email
When a customer creates an order for an e-book
Then they should receive an order confirmation email
Of course, the scenario itself doesn’t test anything. It’s mainly useful to estab-
lish a shared understanding between domain experts and software develop-
ers.
“Seems interesting, where can I learn more?”
The practice of describing application features using high-level scenarios
that don’t zoom in on technology, is known as Specification by Example, Ac-
ceptance Test-Driven Development, or Behavior-Driven Development. I’m
sure there are good reasons to make a distinction between each of these
approaches, but I just wanted to provide a few names that might help you
find more information about it. I can recommend the following books on
the topic:
1. The BDD Books series by Gáspár Nagy and Seb Rosea
2. Gojko Adzic, “Specification by Example”, Manning Publications (2011)

In order to use the scenario as an automated test, we have to write some code
for every step in the scenario. This code is called a step definition, and the
test runner will match each step with a step definition in a so-called Context
class. Listing 14.21 shows an example that uses Behat as test runner.
Listing 14.21. Step definitions in the OrderContext class.
use Behat\Behat\Context\Context;
use PHPUnit\Framework\Assert;
final class OrderContext implements Context
{
private TestServiceContainer $container;
