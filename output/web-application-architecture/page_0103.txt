3. Read models and view models
aCorrect answer: No, the recommended approach is to create a separate read
model.
bCorrect answer:
1.
An interface method that represents the question, e.g.
listAvailableEbooks(), 2. A class that represents the answer to the question,
e.g. Ebook. 3. An implementation for the query method that is able to instantiate
answer objects.
cCorrect answer: 1. Using the data source of the write model for the read model as
well. 2. Using events from the write model to reflect changes in the read model.
dCorrect answer: 1. Entities and 2. Read models. View models are supposed to
provide the data in a way that makes it immediately presentable. A value object
would still need to be converted to a primitive type.
eCorrect answer: 2. Options 1. and 3. are a possibility, not a necessity.
