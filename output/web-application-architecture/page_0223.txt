Listing 8.8. Passing the Ebook read model to the Order entity.
// ...
$order->addLine($ebook, $quantity);
// inside the `Order` class:
public function addLine(Ebook $ebook, int $quantity): void
{
$this->lines[] = new Line(
$ebook->ebookId(),
$ebook->price(),
$quantity
);
}
However, we should be aware that by doing so we may let Order in on too
many details about Ebooks. This depends on how much data the Ebook read
model exposes. If the read model is designed for this specific use case only,
there’s no real danger. In that case the read model only exposes what this
particular client needs. If the read model is also used in other places, it may
expose too much irrelevant information. That may still not be a big problem,
but keep in mind that the fewer methods you expose to a client, the more
flexible your design will be.
One thing you shouldn’t do is pass an entire entity to another object. Rela-
tions should be established by ID, not by object reference. Sharing an entity
exposes all the entity’s modifier methods to clients that don’t intend to (or
shouldn’t intend to) make changes to it.
8.3. Form validation
So far we’ve been looking at ways to prevent bad data from entering our do-
main objects. By now we can be pretty sure that all the data that we keep in-
