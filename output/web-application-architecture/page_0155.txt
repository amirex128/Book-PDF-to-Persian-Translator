Now, how to determine that VAT rate? Looking at the documentation of vatapi.com1
we notice that there is a “VAT Rate Check” API endpoint. They even offer
some examples written in PHP. Copying the code into the service gives us a
more-or-less working feature, as shown in Listing 6.4.
Listing 6.2. EbookOrderService
uses
curl
to
fetch
a
VAT
rate
from
vatapi.com.
public function create(/* ... */): OrderId
{
// ...
$curl = curl_init();
/*
* Search for TBE services (Telecommunications,
* broadcasting & electronic services).
* Filter on "ebooks".
* For now, let's use a hard-coded country code.
*/
$url = 'https://eu.vatapi.com/v2/vat-rate-check?' .
http_build_query(
[
'rate_type' => 'TBE',
'country_code' => 'NL',
'filter' => 'ebooks'
]
);
// @todo Inject the API key as a configuration value
$apiKey = 'THE_SECRET_API_KEY';
curl_setopt_array(
$curl,

CURLOPT_URL => $url,
CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER => true,
