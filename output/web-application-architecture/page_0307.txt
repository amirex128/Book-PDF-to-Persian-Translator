12. Architectural layers
12.2.4. Up and down the layer stack
In most cases, the flow of data through these layers in a runtime application
is as follows (see Figure 12.4):
1. The web framework (infrastructure layer) accepts an incoming HTTP
request.
2. It analyzes the request and finds the right controller (infrastructure
layer) to call.
3. The controller creates a DTO based on the data from the request and
calls an application service (application layer).
4. The application service creates or modifies an entity (domain layer).
5. The application service then hands over the entity to its repository (in-
frastructure layer), in order to save it.
