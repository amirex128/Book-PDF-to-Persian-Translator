14. A testing strategy for decoupled applications
ify the behavior of smaller elements like entities and value objects inside the
core with Unit tests. An application exposes a number of incoming ports and
requires a number of outgoing ports. The adapters for these ports will be
tested with Adapter tests. Adapter tests aren’t unit tests because they involve
infrastructure code; non-unit tests are often called integration or integrated
tests. To verify that all the parts work well together you may add a num-
ber of End-to-end tests, which use the application as a real user would, in an
environment that mimics as much as possible the production environment.
Exercises
1. For each of the following “things to test”, decide which type of test (unit
test, adapter test, use case test, or end-to-end test) should be used for it.a
1. When the customer has paid for the order, they should receive an
invoice.
2. When you create an order it records an OrderWasCreated event.
3. When you save an order using the repository’s save() method, you
can get an equivalent object when you call getById() providing the
same OrderId.
4. When you send a POST request to the /create-order URL this causes
a call to ApplicationInterface::createOrder().
5. When you send a POST request to the /create-order URL then the
/list-orders page shows the newly created order.
2. Which of the following elements do you need for use case tests?b
1. An interface for the application
2. A router
3. A service container
4. An event dispatcher
5. A template renderer
