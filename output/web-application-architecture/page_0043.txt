$order = new Order(
$request->get('ebook_id'),
$request->get('email_address'),
(int)$request->get('quantity'),
(int)$pricePerUnitInCents,
(int)$orderAmount
);
// But how to save an `Order` object to the database?
$ordersGateway = $this->container->get('orders_gateway');
$lastInsertedId = $ordersGateway->insert(
[
// We need a map of columns => values
]
);
// ...
}
The thing we want to save (the Order object), and the thing that can save it
(the OrdersGateway) turn out to be incompatible. But we still want to save the
