9. Conclusion
have to apply dependency inversion and abstract any dependency that com-
municates directly with a secondary actor. A domain-first approach com-
bined with a test-first approach will improve the quality of the application’s
core code, making it more likely to survive the infrastructural changes in the
world around it. Core code has to be object-oriented code that is “object-pure”
which is quite similar to the notion of functionally pure. All dependencies are
made explicit and for every dependency that connects to something outside
the application an abstraction has been introduced. Object-pure code is easy
to test because, by definition, it behaves in a completely deterministic way.
