2. The domain model
2. Infrastructure code, because this is a repository implementation that
uses an external system (the database) to perform its task.
aCorrect answer: it’s a partial abstraction, because it is an interface which is more
abstract than a class, but it still leaks implementation details about the under-
lying persistence mechanism. For instance, it mentions the word “table”.
bCorrect answer: it’s a value object, which in this case wraps the identity value of
an entity.
cCorrect answer: it’s an entity. Its identity is represented using a value object.
Clients have to provide the identity as a constructor argument, making the en-
tity consistent from the start.
dCorrect answers: 1 and 3. By using a smart implementation for identity genera-
tion, we won’t be having duplicate identities.
eCorrect answer: No. According to the rules provided in Chapter 1, this is core
code.
fCorrect answer: Infrastructure code.
