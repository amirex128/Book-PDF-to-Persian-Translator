5. Service locators
testing. Finally, we discussed how using dependency injection everywhere
can push the composition root of your service object graph closer to the ap-
plicationâ€™s entry point.
Exercises
1. What are the advantages of using constructor injection over service lo-
cation?a
2. Why is core code not allowed to rely on global state for dependencies
and contextual information?b
1. Because doing so means that external systems have to be available
at runtime.
2. Because doing so means that a special context needs to be provided
for this code to run in.
3. Categorize these things as job-specific data, dependency, or contextual
information:c
1. The EbookRepository
2. The hostname of the current HTTP request
3. An EbookId
4. A CreateOrder command object
5. The EventDispatcher
4. How should these things be provided to a service, as constructor argu-
ments or as method arguments?d
1. Dependencies
2. Contextual information
3. Job-specific data
4. Configuration values
