11. Key design patterns
somewhere in the core code of the application.
As shown in Figure ??, during a process modelling session you will design
commands, events, read models, effects, and decisions (policies). I personally
like to take it one step further by zooming in on that “System” box. What
happens inside the system should be an implementation detail and it doesn’t
matter for the overall process. But since we have established some useful
patterns, like application services and event subscribers, we can add those
elements to the diagram as well. Figure 11.9 shows what’s inside the system.
If you like, you can use an adapted process modelling session to describe
these elements too.
Figure 11.9. Modelling the elements that are inside the system.
Once you know the elements of the process, how they are named, and how
they interact, you also have a rough idea about how to implement those ele-
ments because you know their underlying design patterns. So you can start
working on the implementation with less fear and fewer doubts. Implement-
ing use cases becomes more like following a recipe. Understanding use cases
