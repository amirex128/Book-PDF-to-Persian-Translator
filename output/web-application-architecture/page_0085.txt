$readModel->setPrice($event->newPrice());
$this->readModelRepository->save($readModel);

Figure 3.1 shows how all the moving parts are working together in this sce-
nario.

Note that setting the price on the read model isn’t the same thing as changing
the price on the entity. The change on the entity is the real change. When we
update the read model, we’re merely reflecting that original change onto our
read model object.
The remaining question is: what happens inside the save() method of the
read model repository? This is an infrastructural concern: do we save it
to the same database where we save our entities to? Do we use a different
database? Maybe we want to store the e-book read model as a document in
our Elasticsearch database, so we can make it easily searchable.
None of this really matters for the core of the application, since we already
have a read model repository interface, which indicates: “I have a particular
need, but I don’t care how you’ll fulfill this need. I also don’t mind if you need
