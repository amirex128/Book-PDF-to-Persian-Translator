12. Architectural layers
belongs to the Infrastructure layer. The other two layers, Domain and Appli-
cation should only contain core code (see Figure 12.3).
Figure 12.3. The infrastructure layer contains infrastructure code, the do-
main and application layer only core code.
12.2.1. The infrastructure layer
Every bit of infrastructure code we’ve encountered so far is going to end up
in the infrastructure layer. This includes:
• Web controllers
• CLI commands
• Write and read model repository implementations
• Services that connect to external systems, like a remote API, or the file
system
• Services that use the current time or generate random data
If you want to decide if code belongs in the infrastructure layer or in one of
the other layers, you should compare the code to the definitions provided in
Chapter 1:
1. Core code doesn’t directly depend on external systems, nor does
it depend on code written for interacting with a specific type of
external system. 2. Core code doesn’t need a specific environment
