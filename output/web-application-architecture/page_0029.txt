Only if code doesn’t require a special context, and also hasn’t been designed
to run in a special context or has dependencies for which this is the case, can
it be considered core code.
Listing 1.6 shows several examples of core code. These classes can be instan-
tiated anywhere, and any client should be able to call any of the available
methods. None of these methods depend on anything outside the applica-
tion itself.
