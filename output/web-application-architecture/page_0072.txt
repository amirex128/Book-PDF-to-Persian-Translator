3. Read models and view models
This chapter covers:
• Creating a new model just for retrieving informa-
tion
• Different solutions for implementing a read model
repository
• Hiding query complexity behind view models (a
special kind of read models)
In the previous chapter we got rid of two of the three SQL queries that were
originally in the controller action:
• We moved the INSERT INTO orders query to the SqlOrderRepository.
• We got rid of the SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID() query by using our own
mechanism to generate identity.
The remaining SQL query does a lookup in the ebooks table to find out the
price of the e-book the user has selected to buy (Listing 3.1).
Listing 3.1. One remaining SQL query inside the controller.
public function orderEbookAction(Request $request): Response
{
$connection = $this->container->get('connection');
// Retrieve the price of the e-book
$ebookPrice = $connection->execute(
'SELECT price FROM ebooks WHERE id = :id',
