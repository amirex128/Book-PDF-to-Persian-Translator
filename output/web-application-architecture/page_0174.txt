It still looks like a unit test because itâ€™s the same test framework that runs this
test. But because of the kind of code it executes, it definitely is an integration
test. I recommend marking the test as such, either by adding an annotation to
the test class (e.g. @group integration) or by defining a dedicated test suite
for integration tests (see Listing 6.15).
Listing 6.15. Define a separate test suite for integration tests in phpunit.xml.
