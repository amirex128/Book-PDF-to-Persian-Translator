2. The domain model
There are two implementation options: either you let the entity prepare the
columns => values array, or you let it expose its internal data as an array
and do the mapping inside the repository. Listing 2.14 shows an example of
the first option.
Listing 2.14. save() retrieves the mapped data from the Order entity.
final class Order
{
// ...
public function mappedData(): array
{
return [
'email' => $this->emailAddress,
'quantity' => $this->quantityOrdered,
// ...
];
}
}
final class SqlOrderRepository implements OrderRepository
{
// ...
public function save(Order $order): int
{
// ...
$data = $order->mappedData();
// $data is an array of columns => values
// ...
}
}
The downside of this approach is that the Order entity has knowledge about
the names and types of the database columns. Whenever a column gets re-
named, you would also have to update the Order class.
