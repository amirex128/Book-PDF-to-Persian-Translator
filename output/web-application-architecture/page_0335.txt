into an Application and Domain layer. Surrounding the hexagon is what you
could call the Outer hexagon. This corresponds to the Infrastructure layer as
we know it. It contains the adapters for the ports of the inner hexagon, effec-
tively allowing communication between the inner hexagon and the outside
world.

13.7. Structuring the Infrastructure layer
In Section 12.4.2 we found a way to subdivide the Domain and Application
layer namespaces and keep those namespaces from becoming large bags of
classes. There is a similar risk when it comes to the Infrastructure namespace,
although I find that in practice it isn’t often a big problem. I don’t often find
myself browsing through the Infrastructure directory. If I need to change
something about some adapter code, I’m usually working on the use case
itself, meaning I’m looking at code in Application or Domain. When I’m look-
ing at an application service or a repository interface for example, I can use
the IDE’s “Find usages” or “Find implementations” functionality and quickly
