11. Key design patterns
11.4.1. Return the identifier of a new entity
Application service methods are command methods: they change entity state
and shouldn’t return anything. However, when an application service cre-
ates a new entity (like the createOrder() method does in Listing 11.7), you
may still return the ID of the new entity. One thing an application service
definitely should not return is the complete entity. As explained before, an
entity is a write model with built-in behaviors for changing its state. It should
not be available to clients that don’t want to change its state. Clients of appli-
cation services are usually controllers and they certainly shouldn’t change
entity state.
What if you want to return some information about the entity in the re-
sponse? In that case use the ID that was returned by the application service
to fetch a view model from its view model repository (Listing 11.9).
Listing 11.9. Fetching a view model inside the controller.
final class OrderController
{
// ...
public function createOrderAction(Request $request): Response
{
$orderId = $this->orderService->createOrder(/* ... */);
$order = $this->orderDetailsRepository->getById($orderId);
return $this->templateRenderer->render(
'order-details.html.twig',
[
'order' => $order
]
);
}
}
See Section 3.5 for more information about view models.
