15. Conclusion
been mostly under-engineering our web applications, and that it’s time to
start doing a better job.
While trying to do so, I hope you’ll keep an eye on the cost and the benefits
of what you’re doing. I hope that you’ll be pragmatic in your work and stay
away from dogmatism. I hope that you’ll keep experimenting and won’t be
afraid to get it wrong. I hope that you’ll succeed in your efforts.
Best of luck,
Matthias
P.S. Let me know how it went!
