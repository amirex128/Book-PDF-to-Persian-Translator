7. Time and randomness
This chapter covers:
• Providing current time and random data as method
arguments
• Introducing abstractions for creating current time
and random data
• Setting up a central place for establishing the cur-
rent time
So far we’ve been looking at obvious ways in which an application reaches
out to something in the outside world. Connecting to a database, the file sys-
tem, or some external web service; the code that does all this work is without
a doubt infrastructure code. But there are some more subtle ways of “reach-
ing out” that we’ll cover in this chapter: retrieving the current time, and pro-
ducing a random value.
Take a look at Listing 7.1. Is this core code?

final class Order
{
private Uuid $id;
private DateTimeImmutable $orderDate;
private function __construct()
{
}
public static function create(): self
