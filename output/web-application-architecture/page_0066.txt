2. The domain model
• Don’t use the same AR entity for changing state and retrieving state.
Separate your model into a write and a read model. Take a look at Chap-
ter 3 for more information about read models.
• Don’t use your AR entity to navigate from one AR entity to other AR
entities. If you want to make a change to a different AR entity, fetch it
by its ID from the corresponding repository.
• Ignore the fact that an AR entity provides typical service facilities like
saving and deleting. Use a repository and double dispatch to perform
these tasks.
As an example, you should consider the save() method of the Order entity
to be unavailable for regular clients. Instead, whenever you want to save an
Order, save it using the repository’s save() method (see Listing 2.30).
Listing 2.30. Saving an AR entity through the repository.
final class ActiveRecordOrderRepository implements OrderRepository
{
public function save(Order $order): void
{
$order->save();
}
// ...
}
Likewise, when you want to retrieve an Order by its ID, use the repository as
well (see Listing 2.31).
Listing 2.31. Retrieving an AR entity through the repository.
final class ActiveRecordOrderRepository implements OrderRepository
{
// ...
public function getById(OrderId $orderId): Order
{
return Order::find($orderId->asString());
}
}
