3. Read models and view models
];
}
return new Response(json_encode($data));
}
}
Read models are supposed to be as user-friendly for its clients as possible.
But this controller still needs to do a relatively large amount of work before
it can show the data to the user. We can make it a lot easier for this client
if the view model objects could be serialized to JSON in one step. There are
many ways to accomplish this. We could let the view model convert itself to
an associative array (see Listing 3.19).
Listing 3.19. A view model with an asArray() method.
final class Ebook
{
// ...
/**
* @return array<string,mixed>
*/
public function asArray(): array
{
return [
'ebookId' => $this->ebookId(),
'title' => $this->title(),
// ...
];
}
}
// Inside the controller:
return new Response(
json_encode(
array_map(
fn (Ebook $ebook) => $ebook->asArray(),
$this->ebooks->listAvailableEbooks()
)
