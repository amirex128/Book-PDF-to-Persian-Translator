3. Read models and view models
the write model, or you can update the read model based on events from the
write model.
In another situation we needed to show some data to the user. Again, we
didn’t reuse the write model for this purpose, but created a dedicated view
model. The view model consists of a view model object, a repository interface
and a repository implementation. The view model object contains all the
required data. In a regular web application a view model has getters that
make it easy to get the data out and render it inside an HTML template. When
a view model is going to be returned as an API response, a requirement is that
it’s serializable in one step.

3. View models
5. What is a true requirement for read models?e
1. They should be synchronized with the write model based on domain
events.
2. They should support the use of case of its clients instead of serving
some generic purpose.
3. They should share the same read model repository interface.
