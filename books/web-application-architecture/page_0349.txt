14. A testing strategy for decoupled applications
Figure 14.2 shows what software elements the adapter test for VatRateProvider -
UsingVatApiDotCom cover. This adapter tests demonstrates that when an ap-
plication service relies on the VatRateProvider interface and the service con-
tainer has been configured to inject an instance of
VatRateProviderUsingVatApiDotCom , it will work and provide whatâ€™s expected
from it.

14.4. Driving tests for incoming port adapters
The implementation of an outgoing port adapter is correct if it fully imple-
ments the port interface and its contract. What defines the effectiveness of an
