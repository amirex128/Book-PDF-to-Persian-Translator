aCorrect answer: Yes. To determine the current time, the application reaches out
to surrounding infrastructure, in this case the system’s clock.
bCorrect answer: No. Even though the code is part of the Symfony framework, it
doesn’t require any special setup to run. It doesn’t require external systems to
be available, and it is not designed to run in a specific context, like the terminal
or a web server.
cCorrect answer: No. Even though the code depends on an interface, the abstrac-
tion of the dependency isn’t complete. The HttpClient interface is designed for
HTTP-based communication with external services and can’t be replaced with
a reasonable alternative in case HTTP is no longer the desired technology.
