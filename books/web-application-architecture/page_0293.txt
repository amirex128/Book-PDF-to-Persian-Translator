Note that the Order read model is part of the Invoicing module. That way,
Invoicing is the owner of the objectâ€™s API so it can be easily modified to meet
future needs of the InvoicingService .
The InvoicingService should be able to retrieve an instance of the Order
read model from a Repository , which should also be owned by the Invoicing
module. To separate the what from the how of retrieving a read model object,
first create a repository interface on which InvoicingService can depend
(see Listing 11.22 ).
Listing 11.22. The InvoicingService gets an Order object from the
OrderRepository interface.
interface OrderRepository
{
public function getById (OrderId $orderId ):Order;
}
