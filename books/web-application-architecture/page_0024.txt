When code follows the first rule, it means you can run it in complete isolation.
Isolation is great for testability. When you want to write an automated test
for core code, it will be very easy. You won’t need to set up a database, create
tables, load fixtures, etc. You won’t need an internet connection, or a hard
disk with files on it in specific locations. All you need is to be able to run the
code, and have some computer memory available.
