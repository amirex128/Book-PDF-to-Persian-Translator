But before we accidentally develop an entire SDK for vatapi.com , we should
take a step back and look at the overall design as it is now. We have created a
VatApi class which provides a more-or-less object-oriented wrapper for the
remote vatapi.com . Indeed, we could now use VatApi as a dependency in
EbookOrderService and leave most of the low-level details to the VatApi class
(see Listing 6.6).
Listing 6.6. The EbookOrderService could use the VatApi service.
final class EbookOrderService
