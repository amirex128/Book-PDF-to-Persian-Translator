13. Ports and adapters
Figure 13.3. The hexagon with three adapters of the port “for creating an
order”.
e-books are available. Every possibility to retrieve information from an ap-
plication should also be represented by a port. And again, the application
has to provide at least one adapter for the port, to facilitate communication
with the actor that wants to use the information. It needs to be delivered in a
particular format (HTML, JSON, CSV, etc.), using a particular communication
protocol (HTTP, AMQP, etc.).
As an example, the “listing available e-books” port of our application could
be represented by a ListAvailableEbooksRepository interface and an Ebook
DTO representing each available e-book (see Listing 13.6).
Listing 13.6. The code representing the “listing available e-books” port.
interface ListAvailableEbooksRepository
{
/**
* @return array<Ebook>
*/
public function listAll ():array ;
}
