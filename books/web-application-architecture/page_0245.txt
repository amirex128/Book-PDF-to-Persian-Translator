8. Validation
ject validation?c
1.A command object should have only string -type properties and they
should all be allowed to be null .
2.Everything that the entity itself validates, should also be validated by
the command object validator.
3.A command object provides structure and ensures that all input data
has been cast to the expected types.
4.You can reuse the entity’s validation logic and value objects when
validating a command object.
aCorrect answer: all, except validators. A validator should provide a list of errors
instead of stopping execution as soon as it encounters an issue.
bCorrect answer: in the controller. The application service is supposed to be ag-
nostic about its surrounding infrastructure so it doesn’t know anything about
the web or HTML forms. A controller knows about the user and how it should
present validation errors to them.
cCorrect answer: 3 and 4. A command object should have properties that are
already cast to the correct primitive type, and not all of them have to be nullable.
Also, you don’t have to validate everything. If you have a good user interface,
you don’t need to validate most of the input. The entity will protect itself against
bad data anyway.
