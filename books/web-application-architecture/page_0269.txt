11. Key design patterns
throw new LogicException(
sprintf (
'Order %s was already cancelled' ,
$this ->id->asString ()
)
);
}
}
}
11.2.3. Model state changes as actions with state transitions
When an update to a particular field actually represents an action performed
on the object, define a method for it. The job of this method, again, is to
validate the arguments provided to it. It also has to verify that the action is
allowed, given the current state of the object. As an example, an order may be
cancelled, but only if it hasnâ€™t been delivered yet. Instead of a setCancelled()
method, an Order entity would have a cancel() method, which performs the
required checks (see Listing 11.3).
Listing 11.3. The cancel() action is only available when the object is in a
certain state.
final class Order
{
// ...
private bool $wasCancelled ;
private bool $wasDelivered ;
public function cancel ():void
{
if($this ->wasDelivered ) {
throw new LogicException(
sprintf (
'Order %s has already been delivered' ,
$this ->id->asString ()
)
);
}
