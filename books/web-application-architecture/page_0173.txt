Figure 6.4. Introducing an abstraction makes EbookOrderService testable in

1.Is a correct and complete implementation of the interface weâ€™ve defined

2.Correctly integrates with the external service
Once we can prove that, we can be sure that any client that needs a VatRateProvider

Listing 6.14 shows a test that demonstrates that a VatRateProviderUsingVatApiDotCom
object is able to provide the correct VAT rate for e-books sold in the Nether-
lands.
