We could call this type of object a Façade2. It “defines a higher-level inter-
face that makes the subsystem easier to use”. You will often find classes like
VatApi in a so-called SDK (software development kit). An API vendor some-
times offers these as programming language-specific libraries. They allow
developers to use an API as if it were a local service.
The new vatRateCheck() method is generic enough to be usable in our
EbookOrderService class, but it isn’t very user-friendly at the moment. Clients
get the raw response data as an array and have to manually extract the VAT
rate from this array. The problem with arrays is that their shape is unde-
fined. Clients wouldn’t know how they can extract from it the information
they need. In our application we’d find code like this:
$responseData =$this ->vatApi ->vatRateCheck (
