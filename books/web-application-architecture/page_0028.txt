Some code could in theory run in any environment, but in practice it will be
awkward to do so. Consider the example in Listing 1.5. The OrderController
could be instantiated in any context, and it would be relatively easy to call
the action method and pass it an instance of RequestInterface . However, itâ€™s
clear that this code has been designed to run in a very specific environment
only, namely a web application.
