14. A testing strategy for decoupled applications
entity after it has been modified.
Make sure that everything about the setup of the repository implementa-
tions is as real as possible. That is, use a real database, preferably the same
database that you use in production. Don’t create test doubles for anything.
Make sure this test will expose any problem with the code that would other-
wise only show up once the code is running in production. Figure 14.1 shows
the result of this approach: a contract test for OrderRepository will invoke
all the software elements involved in using the actual database. Such a test
demonstrates that if an application service in the core of the application re-
lies on the OrderRepository interface, and the service container has been
configured to inject an instance of OrderRepositoryUsingDoctrineDbal , ev-
erything will work just fine.

Something to keep in mind when writing a contract test is that you shouldn’t
