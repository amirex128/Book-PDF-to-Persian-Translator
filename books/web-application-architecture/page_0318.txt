13. Ports and adapters
This chapter covers:
•Hexagonal architecture
•Ports and adapters
•Structuring the Infrastructure layer
In the previous chapter we’ve explored layers as a way of grouping different
types of objects in an application. In this chapter, we switch to a different
perspective. We look at how an application is connected to the outside world
and how we can group those connections in a logical way. We use ideas from
Hexagonal architecture to accomplish this.
13.1. Hexagonal architecture
Hexagonal architecture is invented by Alistair Cockburn1. Cockburn describes
the intent of this architectural style as follows:
Allow an application to equally be driven by users, programs, au-
tomated test or batch scripts, and to be developed and tested in
isolation from its eventual run-time devices and databases.
I think this makes it pretty clear that hexagonal architecture is a suitable final
