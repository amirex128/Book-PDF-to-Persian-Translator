14.2. Adapter tests
We’ve already determined that you can’t unit-test infrastructure code. But
you still want to test it somehow, so what type of test can we use for infras-
tructure code? Infrastructure tests are often called integration tests, or inte-
grated tests. These tests show that infrastructure code including third-party
code correctly integrates with external actors. In Chapter 13we used an-
other name for code that integrates with external actors: “port adapters”, or
