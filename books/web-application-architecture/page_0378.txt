15. Conclusion
This chapter covers:
•Objections
•Trade-offs
We’ve reached the last chapter of this book, and it’s not going to introduce
more concepts. I wanted to use this chapter to reflect on what has been dis-
cussed so far, and to figure out if or when you can use the techniques de-
scribed in this book in your own projects.
Any advice given to you requires careful analysis in your own context. The
advice may sound intuitively right at first, but when considering the specifics
of your own project, your own work situation, etc. the advice may be prob-
lematic. You may be worried that it’s going to take a lot of effort to follow
the advice. Maybe you know in advance that some team members will have
trouble following it. And maybe you’re afraid of “doing it wrong” and this
prevents you from finishing the project.
If you consider this book as my advice to design your application in a certain
way, then you may have also found it questionable at times. Of course I’m
not sure what your personal questions or objections are, but I have collected
some questions from readers and workshop participants and I’ll be respond-
ing to them in this chapter, hoping that they provide some answers to you as
well. If this leaves some of your own questions unanswered, don’t hesitate
to get in touch and ask them directly.
