Introduction
1. Preface
My last book, the Object Design Style Guide , ends with chapter 10 - “A field
guide to objects”, showing the characteristics of some common types of ob-
jects like controllers ,entities ,value objects ,repositories ,event subscribers , etc.
The chapter finishes with an overview of how these different types of objects
find their natural place in a set of architectural layers. Some readers pointed
out that the field guide itself was not detailed enough to help them use these
types of objects in their own projects. And some people objected that the
architectural concepts briefly described in this chapter could not easily be
applied to real-world projects either. They are totally right; that last chapter
turned out to be more of a teaser than a treatise. Unfortunately I couldn’t
think of an alternative resource that I could provide to those readers. There
are some good articles and books on this topic, but they cover only some of
the patterns and architectural concepts. As far as I know, there is no com-
prehensive guide about all of these patterns combined. So I decided to write
it myself: a showcase of design patterns, like entities and application ser-
vices, explaining how they all work together in a “well-architected” applica-
tion. However, a plain description of existing patterns isn’t nearly as useful
as showing how you could have invented them by yourself, simply by try-
ing to decouple your application code from its surrounding infrastructure.
That’s how this book became a guide to decoupling your domain model and
your application’s use cases from the framework, the database, and so on.
