There are different options here. The most common one is to install an ORM
in your project, which can do the mapping from object properties to table
columns for you.
2.5.1. Using an ORM
In Section 2.8we’ll talk about what type of ORM works best in this scenario.
For now, let’s look at an example using the popular Doctrine ORM6. Once
we have installed Doctrine ORM in our project and have set up the database
connection we first need to add mapping configuration to the entity class and
its properties. Listing 2.11 shows how to do that using annotations.
Listing 2.11. Using annotations for mapping configuration.
use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping asORM;
/**
* @ORM\Entity
* @ORM\Table(name="orders")
*/
final class Order
{
/**
* @ORM\Id
* @ORM\GeneratedValue
