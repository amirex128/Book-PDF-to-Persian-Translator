14. A testing strategy for decoupled
applications
This chapter covers:
•Different types of tests and how they cover all
parts of the application
•A development workflow for decoupled applica-
tions
Why did we want to decouple from infrastructure again? Because this al-
lows us to focus on the high-level use cases of the application instead of the
low-level implementation details. Because it enables the application core to
survive all kinds of unrelated changes in the surrounding environment. And
because it gives us a lot of code that is testable by default. In this chapter I’d
like to take a closer look at this aspect: testability. And I’d like to give the
outline for an answer to the question: what should be tested and how should
we test it?
Test terminology has always been a problem for developers talking and writ-
ing about testing. The terms I use in this chapter for different types of tests
may not be standard terms. But I think they are appropriate in the context
of this book.
14.1. Unit tests
The simplest type of test is a unit test. It’s quite a problematic name for such
a simple test because it’s really not clear what a “unit” is or how big it should
