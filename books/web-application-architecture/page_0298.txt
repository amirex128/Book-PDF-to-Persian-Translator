11. Key design patterns
explained by Alberto Brandolini in “Introducing Event Storming”3. There he
calls it “Process Modelling”. In my experience it’s a very useful technique. It
fits well between higher-level design sessions where the focus is on the prob-
lem domain, and lower-level design sessions where the programmers want
to take a step in the direction of the solution. In a process modelling session
they can use domain concepts and knowledge about the desired process and
create a useful model for the software based on design patterns that are fa-
miliar to them. Figure ??can be used as a reference for such a session.

After years of developing software, for me it was a pretty revolutionary idea
to consider the user as someone who is influenced by the real world, who
lets the system inform them about something, and who then makes a deci-
sion based on this information. I realized that retrieving information from
a system should be considered an important use case, just as important as a
use case where the user decides to do something. I also realized that to suc-
cessfully decouple from infrastructure both types of use cases should exist
