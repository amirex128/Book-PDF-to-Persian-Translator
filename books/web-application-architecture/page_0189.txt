Weâ€™re still using the original objects provided by the ramsey/uuid1library
and the PHP standard library. But now we have interfaces that allow us to
use those objects without relying on their service responsibilities. Whenever
we need a DateTimeImmutable instance we use the Clock . When we need a
Uuid , we use the UuidFactory . We never have to instantiate these objects
ourselves and when we use the new service abstractions it will be totally
clear that we expect their implementations to reach out to external systems.
Figure 7.3shows what the situation looks like now.

In our test we could now use the new services (see Listing 7.7).
