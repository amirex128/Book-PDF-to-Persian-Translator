2. The domain model
{
return new self( $orderId );
}
}
3. Is the following class an entity or a value object?c
final class Order
{
// ...
public static function create (OrderId $orderId ):self
{
return new self( $orderId );
}
}
4. Why should we generate an identity value for an entity before instanti-
ating it for the first time?d
1.Because the entity wouldnâ€™t be complete, nor behave consistently,
without an identity.
2.Because otherwise the same identity might be used in another pro-
cess.
3.Because by letting the database determine it, we are implicitly re-
lying on its ability to do so, which might not be true for alternative
persistence mechanisms.
5. Should the following code be considered mixed code (combining core
and infrastructure code)?e
use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping asORM;
/**
* @Entity
* @Table(name="todo_items")
*/
final class ToDoItem
{
