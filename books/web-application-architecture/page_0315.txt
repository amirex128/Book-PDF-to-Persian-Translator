12. Architectural layers
correct layer.4However, there is a tool that can verify that the code follows
theDependency rule :deptrac5Listing 12.2 shows how you can configure it
to recognize layering conventions based on namespaces. Under the ruleset
key you can define the allowed dependency directions between layers.
Listing 12.2. Using this configuration deptrac can check if code follows the
Dependency rule .
paths :
- ./src
layers :
-name : Infrastructure
collectors :
-type : className
regex : .*\\Infrastructure\\.*
-name : Domain
collectors :
-type : className
regex : .*\\Domain\\.*
-name : Application
collectors :
-type : className
regex : .*\\Application\\.*
ruleset :
Infrastructure :
- Application
- Domain
Application :
- Domain
Domain :
# nothing
Running deptrac as part of your projectâ€™s build can easily point out layering
issues.
