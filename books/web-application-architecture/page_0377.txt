14. A testing strategy for decoupled applications
3. Which of the following elements shouldn’t be unit-tested?c
1.A controller
2.An application service
3.An entity
4.A value object
5.A repository implementation
aCorrect answer: 1 use case test, 2 unit test, 3 adapter test (more specifically: a
contract test), 4 adapter test, 5 end-to-end test.
bCorrect answer: 1, 3 and 4.
cCorrect answer: 1 A controller should be tested with an adapter test or an end-
to-end test because it’s not core code. 2 An application service is core code so it
can be unit-tested, but it makes more sense to test it as part of a use case test.
5 A repository implementation is infrastructure code so it requires an adapter
test, which is not a unit test but an integration test.
